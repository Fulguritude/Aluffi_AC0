\section*{Notes on counterintuitive rules}

\begin{itemize}
	\item in some categories (such as $\mathbb{Z}$ with $\leq$; or \textbf{Ring}), "mono and epi" does not imply "iso"
	\item in every \textit{abelian} category, we have that "iso $\Leftrightarrow$ epi and mono" (and though \textbf{Set} is not abelian, the property still holds)
	\item while in \textbf{Set}, a function is an epimorphism (surjective) iff it has a pre-inverse, in \textbf{Grp}, some epimorphisms do not have right inverses.
\end{itemize}
