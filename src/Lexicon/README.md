# Description

A lexicon of terms per chapter.

Each term should have:

  - a formal (algebraic) definition,

  - an intuitive, caricatural, definition,

  - some detailed examples of the concept (trivial and non-trivial),

  - some detailed non-examples of the concept (something close to an example, but which fails being a valid example for a specific reason),

  - if possible, some diagrams or visuals.
