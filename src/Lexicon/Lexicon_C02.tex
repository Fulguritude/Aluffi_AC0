\chapter*{Chapter 1}

\section*{Section 1}

\begin{itemize}
	\item group (groupoid with single object / structure that is associative, unitary, and invertible)
	\item binary operation
	\item trivial group
	\item cancellation
	\item order $|g|$ (of an element $g$ of a group $G$): the smallest amount of times $n = |g|$ that this element must be repeatedly given to the binary operation before the result becomes $e$, the identity of the group. If this doesn't happen, then the order is said to be infinite and we write $|g| = \inf$.
	\item order $|G|$ (of a group $G$): a synonym for the cardinal of $G$, the (potentially infinite) amount of elements of $G$.
\end{itemize}


\section*{Section 2}

\begin{itemize}
	\item symmetric group: the group of all permutations of a set $X$, denoted $S_X$.
	\item dihedral group: the group of symmetries of a regular polygon, denoted $D_n$ or $D_{2n}$.
	\item cyclic group: a group that is generated by a single element and acts like some kind of "clock", denoted $\langle g \rangle$.
	\item generators of a group: a subset of a group $G$ for which the closure under the operation of the group is $G$.
\end{itemize}
