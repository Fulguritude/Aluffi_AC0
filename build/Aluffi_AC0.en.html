<p>Chapter I) 1) Set notation)</p>
<p>Write the following in set notation (as a list of numbers, and algebraically): - the set of all odd integers - the set of all integers that are not multiples of 3 - the set of integers from 10 (included) to 20 (included) - the set of integers from 10 (included) to 20 (excluded) - the set of pairs of integers with both elements of the same value - the set of triplets of real numbers that together sum to 1 - the set of pairs of positive real numbers that together sum to 1 - the set of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-tuplets (for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>) of real number that together sum to 1 - the set of all natural numbers such that there exists at least one triplet of positive even numbers which are all different and which sum to that number.</p>
<p>Now take the sets in their algebraic notation, and represent them both as a list of numbers (as a logical sequence or just a couple of examples), and as a "description" of what they are:</p>
<p>- <span class="math inline">\(\{3n + 2 \; | \; n \in \mathbb{N} \}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\{3k + 2 \; | \; k \in \mathbb{Z} \}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\{ 2^i \; | \; i \in [[0, 10]] \}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\{ (x, y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 \; | \; x^2 + y^2 = 1 \}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\{ x \in \mathbb{R} \; | \; -2 \leq x \leq 2 \}\)</span> - <span class="math inline">\(\{ (m, n, p) \in \mathbb{N}^3 \; | \; m + n + p = 10 \}\)</span> Section 1</p>
<p>- Set (not a multiset) - âˆ…: the empty set, containing no elements; - N: the set of natural numbers (that is, nonnegative integers); - Z: the set of integers; - Q: the set of rational numbers; - R: the set of real numbers; - C: the set of complex numbers. - Singleton: - âˆƒ: existential quantifier, "there exists" - âˆ€: universal quantifier, "for all" - inclusion: - subset: - cardinal: - powerset: - âˆª: the union: - âˆ©: the intersection: -<br />
: the difference: - : the disjoint union: - Ã—: the (Cartesian) product: - complement of a subset - relation - order relation - equivalence relation - reï¬‚exivity - symmetry - antisymmetry - transitivity - partition - quotient by an equivalence relation</p>
<p>Section 2</p>
<p>- function - graph - (categorical, function) diagram - identity function - kernel (of a function) - image (of a function) - restriction (of a function to a subset) - multiset - composition - commutative (diagram) - injection - surjection - bijection - isomorphism - inverse - pre-inverse, right-inverse - post-inverse, left-inverse - monomorphism - epimorphism - natural projection - natural injection - canonical decomposition (of a function)</p>

<h2 id="on-injections-and-surjections">On injections and surjections</h2>
<h3 id="injections">Injections</h3>
<p>Injections (which arenâ€™t also surjections) have multiple left-inverses (post-inverses). Eg:</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(A = \{ a, b    \}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(B = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to B = \{ (a, 2), (b, 3) \}\)</span>, injective</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g_1 : B \to A = \{ (1, a), (2, a), (3, b) \}\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(g_2 : B \to A = \{ (1, b), (2, a), (3, b) \}\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f = id_A\]</span></p>
<p>It is precisely the free element with no antecedent in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (here, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) which leaves room for multiple choices, but doesnâ€™t affect the overall inversion process.</p>
<h3 id="surjections">Surjections</h3>
<p>Surjections (which arenâ€™t also injections) have multiple right-inverses (pre-inverses), called sections.</p>
<p>B = 123 A = ab f : B A = 1a 2a 3b, surjective</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g_1 : A \to B = a1 b3\)</span> <span class="math inline">\(g_2 : A \to B = a2 b3\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 = id_A\]</span></p>
<p>It is precisely the fact that there are multiple elements that map to the same element (here, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>) which leaves room for multiple choices, but doesnâ€™t affect the overall inversion process.</p>
<h3 id="cancellations">Cancellations</h3>
<p>Function Cancellation Lemma: If a composition of functions cancels out, then the first of the pair is an injection, and the second of the pair is a surjection. Algebraically: <span class="math display">\[\forall A, B \in Obj(\textbf{Set}),
f \in (A \to B), g \in (B \to A), \;
    g \circ f = id_A
\Rightarrow
    \begin{cases}
        f \text{ is injective} \\
        g \text{ is surjective}
    \end{cases}\]</span> Corollary 1: any post-inverse of an injection is a surjection. Corollary 2: any pre-inverse of a surjection is an injection.</p>
<p>Proof: Let be <span class="math display">\[A, B \in Obj(\textbf{Set}), f \in (A \to B), g \in (B \to A), \; g \circ f = id_A\]</span></p>
<p>a) Suppose <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not an injection. This means: <span class="math display">\[\exists x, y \in B, \; x \neq y \text{ and } g(x) = g(y)\]</span> However, with such an <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, we have: <span class="math display">\[g(x) = g(y) \Rightarrow f(g(x)) = f(g(y)) = id_A(x) = id_A(y) = x = y\]</span> This means that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an injection. Contradiction. Conclusion: in this context, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> must be an injection.</p>
<p>b) Suppose <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is not a surjection. This means: <span class="math display">\[\exists a \in A, \; a \notin g(B)\]</span> Since <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f = id_A\)</span>, that means that <span class="math inline">\(g(f(a)) = id_A(a) = a\)</span>, this means that <span class="math inline">\(a \in g(B)\)</span>. Contradiction. Conclusion: in this context, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> must be a surjection.</p>
<h2 id="on-sections-and-fibers">On sections and fibers</h2>
<p>Section example with a tangent bundle.</p>
<p>Consider the cylinder <span class="math inline">\(S^1 \times \mathbb{R}\)</span>, and the function <span class="math inline">\(f : S^1 \times \mathbb{R} \to S^1\)</span>, the projection onto the circle. The cylinder is itself the space in which one can easily represent maps of <span class="math inline">\((S^1 \to \mathbb{R})\)</span>. Each such map corresponds to a section.</p>
<p>Let be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{align*}
g_1 : S^1    &amp; \longrightarrow  S^1 \times \mathbb{R} \\

      \theta &amp; \longmapsto      (\theta, cos(\theta))

<p>We have <span class="math display">\[f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 = id_{S^1}\]</span></p>
<p>(TODO add diagrams for S1xR, g1 and g2)</p>
<p>A fiber is the preimage of a singleton. In the case of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> above, for every <span class="math inline">\(q \in S^1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}({q})\)</span> is the copy of the real line on the cylinder that passes by <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span>.</p>

<h3 id="example-of-failing-the-monomorphism-definition-for-a-non-injection">Example of failing the monomorphism definition for a non-injection</h3>
<p>Monomorphism definition:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\text{$f : A \to B$ is a monomorphism}
\; \; \Leftrightarrow \; \; 
\forall Z \in \text{Obj}(\mathcal{C}), \;
\forall g_1, g_2 \in \text{Hom}(Z, A), \;

<p>The multiple choice of elements in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> which map to <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (here, <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>) is precisely what allows the overall composition to be equal, even when <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \neq g_2\)</span>. This provides insight into a proof of "<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a monomorphism implies that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an injection". If you suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a monomorphism and not an injection, you can easily reach a contradiction, since you can use elements like <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> that both map to the same <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to construct a counter-example to the implication that defines a monomorphism.</p>
<h3 id="example-of-failing-the-epimorphism-definition-for-a-non-surjection">Example of failing the epimorphism definition for a non-surjection</h3>
<p>Epimorphism definition:</p>

<p><span class="math display">\[g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f = \{(a, x), (b, y)\} \in (A \to Z)\]</span></p>
<p>The element <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> not being reached by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is precisely that which provides the opportunity to build <span class="math inline">\(g_1 \neq g_2\)</span> such that they compose to the same result with <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, since the output of <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> for them doesnâ€™t affect the overall composition. This provides insight into a proof of "<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an epimorphism implies that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a surjection". If you suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an epimorphism and not a surjection, you can easily reach a contradiction, since you can use elements like <span class="math inline">\(3\)</span> that are not reached by <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to construct a counter-example to the implication that defines an epimorphism.</p>

<p>If <span class="math inline">\(\empty\)</span> is initial and <span class="math inline">\(\{ \star \}\)</span> is terminal, it is because a function in <span class="math inline">\(Set\)</span> (in categorical terms) must always have an output for every input. Ie, in category theory, all functions are maps ("applications").</p>
<p>Said algebraically:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\forall A, B \in \text{Obj}(\bold{Set}), \;
\forall a \in A, \;
\forall f \in \text{Hom}(A, B), \;
\exists f(a) \in B\]</span></p>
<p>In the case of <span class="math inline">\(\empty\)</span> as the input set, and there is only one function <span class="math inline">\(f: \empty \to Z\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the empty mapping. But any <span class="math inline">\(Z \to \empty\)</span> (expept <span class="math inline">\(\empty \to \empty\)</span>) contains no mapping (since weâ€™d necessarily be ignoring at least one element of <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>).</p>
<p>Similarly, in the case of the (unique up-to-isomorphism) singleton set <span class="math inline">\(\{ \star \}\)</span> as the output, youâ€™d have multiple functions (precisely <span class="math inline">\(2^{#Z}\)</span>) into it, if you could ignore some elements of the input set.
