Multiversity Algebra Chapter 0 Reading Group

Chapter I) 1) Set notation)

Write the following in set notation (as a list of numbers, and
algebraically): - the set of all odd integers - the set of all integers
that are not multiples of 3 - the set of integers from 10 (included) to
20 (included) - the set of integers from 10 (included) to 20 (excluded)
- the set of pairs of integers with both elements of the same value -
the set of triplets of real numbers that together sum to 1 - the set of
pairs of positive real numbers that together sum to 1 - the set of
n-tuplets (for any n) of real number that together sum to 1 - the set of
all natural numbers such that there exists at least one triplet of
positive even numbers which are all different and which sum to that
number.

Now take the sets in their algebraic notation, and represent them both
as a list of numbers (as a logical sequence or just a couple of
examples), and as a "description" of what they are:

- {3n + 2 | n ∈ ℕ} - {3k + 2 | k ∈ ℤ} - {2^(i) | i ∈ [[0, 10]]} -
{(x, y) ∈ ℝ² | x² + y² = 1} - {x ∈ ℝ |  − 2 ≤ x ≤ 2} -
{(m, n, p) ∈ ℕ³ | m + n + p = 10} Section 1

Chapter 1, Section 2

On injections and surjections

Injections

Injections (which aren’t also surjections) have multiple left-inverses
(post-inverses). Eg:

A = {a, b} B = {1, 2, 3} f : A → B = {(a, 2), (b, 3)}, injective

g₁ : B → A = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b)}
g₂ : B → A = {(1, b), (2, a), (3, b)}

g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f = id_(A)

It is precisely the free element with no antecedent in B (here, 1) which
leaves room for multiple choices, but doesn’t affect the overall
inversion process.

Surjections

Surjections (which aren’t also injections) have multiple right-inverses
(pre-inverses), called sections.

B = 123 A = ab f : B A = 1a 2a 3b, surjective

g₁ : A → B = a1b3 g₂ : A → B = a2b3

f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ = id_(A)

It is precisely the fact that there are multiple elements that map to
the same element (here, 1 and 2 to a) which leaves room for multiple
choices, but doesn’t affect the overall inversion process.

Cancellations

Function Cancellation Lemma: If a composition of functions cancels out,
then the first of the pair is an injection, and the second of the pair
is a surjection. Algebraically:
$$\forall A, B \in Obj(\textbf{Set}),
f \in (A \to B), g \in (B \to A), \;
    g \circ f = id_A
\Rightarrow
    \begin{cases}
        f \text{ is injective} \\
        g \text{ is surjective}
    \end{cases}$$
Corollary 1: any post-inverse of an injection is a surjection. Corollary
2: any pre-inverse of a surjection is an injection.

Proof: Let be
A, B ∈ Obj(Set), f ∈ (A → B), g ∈ (B → A), g ∘ f = id_(A)

a) Suppose f is not an injection. This means:
∃x, y ∈ B, x ≠ y and g(x) = g(y)
However, with such an f, we have:
g(x) = g(y) ⇒ f(g(x)) = f(g(y)) = id_(A)(x) = id_(A)(y) = x = y
This means that f is an injection. Contradiction. Conclusion: in this
context, f must be an injection.

b) Suppose g is not a surjection. This means:
∃a ∈ A, a ∉ g(B)
Since g ∘ f = id_(A), that means that g(f(a)) = id_(A)(a) = a, this
means that a ∈ g(B). Contradiction. Conclusion: in this context, g must
be a surjection.

On sections and fibers

Section example with a tangent bundle.

Consider the cylinder S¹ × ℝ, and the function f : S¹ × ℝ → S¹, the
projection onto the circle. The cylinder is itself the space in which
one can easily represent maps of (S¹ → ℝ). Each such map corresponds to
a section.

Let be

$$\begin{align*}
g_1 : S^1    & \longrightarrow  S^1 \times \mathbb{R} \\
      \theta & \longmapsto      (\theta, 1)
\end{align*}$$

$$\begin{align*}
g_2 : S^1    & \longrightarrow  S^1 \times \mathbb{R} \\
      \theta & \longmapsto      (\theta, cos(\theta))
\end{align*}$$

We have
f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ = id_(S¹)

(TODO add diagrams for S1xR, g1 and g2)

A fiber is the preimage of a singleton. In the case of f above, for
every q ∈ S¹, f^( − 1)(q) is the copy of the real line on the cylinder
that passes by q.

(TODO add diagram)

Alternative characterization of a bijection

f is bijective "every element of B has a non-empty fiber" (surjection)
and "every fiber is a singleton" (injection)

On monomorphisms and epimorphisms

Failing the mono/epi condition

Example of failing the monomorphism definition for a non-injection

Monomorphism definition:

f : A → B is a monomorphism  ⇔  ∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀g₁, g₂ ∈ Hom(Z, A), (f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ ⇒ g₁ = g₂)

A = ab B = 123 Z = xy f : A B = 1a 2a 3b, not an injection

g₁ : Z → A = x1y3 g₂ : Z → A = x2y3

f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ = {(x, a), (y, b)} ∈ (Z → B)

The multiple choice of elements in A which map to a in B (here, 1 and 2)
is precisely what allows the overall composition to be equal, even when
g₁ ≠ g₂. This provides insight into a proof of "f is a monomorphism
implies that f is an injection". If you suppose that f is a monomorphism
and not an injection, you can easily reach a contradiction, since you
can use elements like 1 and 2 that both map to the same a to construct a
counter-example to the implication that defines a monomorphism.

Example of failing the epimorphism definition for a non-surjection

Epimorphism definition:

f : A → B is an epimorphism  ⇔  ∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀g₁, g₂ ∈ Hom(B, Z), (g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f ⇒ g₁ = g₂)

A = ab B = 123 Z = xy f : A B = a1 b2, not an surjection

g₁ : B → Z = 1x2y3x g₂ : B → Z = 1x2y3y

g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f = {(a, x), (b, y)} ∈ (A → Z)

The element 3 in B not being reached by f is precisely that which
provides the opportunity to build g₁ ≠ g₂ such that they compose to the
same result with f, since the output of 3 for them doesn’t affect the
overall composition. This provides insight into a proof of "f is an
epimorphism implies that f is a surjection". If you suppose that f is an
epimorphism and not a surjection, you can easily reach a contradiction,
since you can use elements like 3 that are not reached by f to construct
a counter-example to the implication that defines an epimorphism.

Proofs of mono/inj and epi/surj equivalence

Let f : A → B.

The parts which are "Injection => Monomorphism" and "Surjection =>
Epimorphism" both use the respective sided inverses to prove the
implication.

The other parts use the following tautology to prove the implication by
contradiction. "Suppose that p and ¬q, show that it leads to a
contradiction".

(p ⇒ q) ⇔ ((¬p) ∪ q) ⇔ (¬(p ∩ ¬q))

Injection => Monomorphism

Suppose that f is an injection. It thus has post-inverses.

∃g ∈ (B → A), g ∘ f = id_(A)

From there:

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀a, b ∈ Hom(Z, A),
$$\begin{array}{ccccc} \\
f \circ a = f \circ b & \Rightarrow &  g \circ (f  \circ a) &=&  g \circ (f  \circ b) \\
                      & =           & (g \circ  f) \circ a  &=& (g \circ  f) \circ b  \\
                      & =           &         id_A \circ a  &=&         id_A \circ b  \\
                      & =           &                    a  &=&                    b
\end{array}$$

We conclude that f is also a monomorphism.

Surjection => Epimorphism

Suppose that f is a surjection. It thus has pre-inverses.

∃g ∈ (B → A), f ∘ g = id_(B)

From there:

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀a, b ∈ Hom(B, Z),
$$\begin{array}{ccccc} \\
a \circ f = b \circ f & \Rightarrow & (a \circ  f) \circ g  &=& (b \circ  f) \circ g  \\
                      & =           &  a \circ (f  \circ g) &=&  b \circ (f  \circ g) \\
                      & =           &  a \circ  id_B        &=&  b \circ  id_B        \\
                      & =           &  a                    &=&  b
\end{array}$$

We conclude that f is also an epimorphism.

Monomorphism => Injection

Suppose that f is a monomorphism.

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀g₁, g₂ ∈ Hom(Z, A), f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ ⇒ g₁ = g₂

Suppose now that f is not an injection. Algebraically, this means that:

∃(x, y) ∈ A²,  such that x ≠ y and f(x) = f(y)

We can construct g₁ and g₂ such that f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ but g₁ ≠ g₂, using
such a pair (x, y). Thereby, we prove that f is not an monomorphism and
arrive at a contradiction.

(If Z is the empty set, being initial in , there is only 1 map into A
(the empty map) and a = b always hold. Therefore, any counterexample to
the epimorphism definition needs to have at least 1 element.)

Let Z = {a}.

g₁(a) = x
g₂(a) = y

Clearly, g₁ ≠ g₂. However, we also have:

f(g₁(a)) = f(x) = f(y) = f(g₂(a)) ⇒ f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂

This means that f is not a monomorphism: contradiction.

Conclusion: f is an injection.

Epimorphism => Surjection

Suppose that f is an epimorphism.

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀g₁, g₂ ∈ Hom(B, Z), g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f ⇒ g₁ = g₂

Suppose now that f isn’t a surjection. Algebraically, this means that:

∃x ∈ B, x ∉ f(A)

We can construct g₁ and g₂ such that g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f but g₁ ≠ g₂, using
such an x ∉ f(A). Thereby, we prove that f is not an epimorphism and
arrive at a contradiction.

(If Z is the singleton set, being terminal in , there is only 1 map into
Z and a = b always hold. Therefore, any counterexample to the
epimorphism definition needs to have at least 2 elements. We will
however use a 3-element set, since it makes things more intuitive and
pedagogical.)

Let Z = {a, b, c}.

$$g_1 =
\begin{cases}
    \forall x    \in f(A), g_1(x) = a \\
    \forall x \notin f(A), g_1(x) = b
\end{cases}$$

$$g_2 =
\begin{cases}
    \forall x    \in f(A), g_2(x) = a \\
    \forall x \notin f(A), g_2(x) = c
\end{cases}$$

Clearly, g₁ ≠ g₂. However, since A is the domain of f, of g₁ ∘ f, and of
g₂ ∘ f, we have:

g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f = (x ↦ a) ∈ (A → Z)

This means that f is not an epimorphism: contradiction.

Conclusion: f is a surjection.

Chapter 1, Section 3

On terminal and initial objects in Set

If $\empty$ is initial and { ⋆ } is terminal, it is because a function
in Set (in categorical terms) must always have an output for every
input. Ie, in category theory, all functions are maps ("applications").

Said algebraically:

$$\forall A, B \in \text{Obj}(\bold{Set}), \;
\forall a \in A, \;
\forall f \in \text{Hom}(A, B), \;
\exists f(a) \in B$$

In the case of $\empty$ as the input set, and there is only one function
$f: \empty \to Z$ for any Z: f is the empty mapping. But any
$Z \to \empty$ (expept $\empty \to \empty$) contains no mapping (since
we’d necessarily be ignoring at least one element of Z).

Similarly, in the case of the (unique up-to-isomorphism) singleton set
{ ⋆ } as the output, you’d have multiple functions (precisely $2^{#Z}$)
into it, if you could ignore some elements of the input set. However, if
all elements of the input set are required, that leaves you with only
one function possible from Z → { ⋆ }: the function which maps all
elements to ⋆.

Restrictions and extensions of functions, and its consequences on a function’s nature

8 possibilities to study, based on the following binary dichotomies: -
injection or surjection - enlarging or restricting - domain or codomain

Note that enlarging the domain sometimes implies enlarging the codomain,
and restricting the codomain sometimes implies restricting the domain.

Theorems:

A) if f ∈ (A → B), f injective (resp. surjective), then
$\forall Z \subseteq B, \hat{f} \in ((A \ap f^{-1}(Z)) \to Z), \hat{f} = f|_{f^{-1}(Z)}$,
the restriction of the function to the corresponding smaller codomain,
is also an injection (resp. surjection).

B) if f ∈ (A → B), f injective (resp. surjective), then
∀Z ⊇ B, f̂ ∈ (A → Z), f̂ = ι ∘ f (with the ι the canonical injection of
b ∈ B into its superset Z), is also an injection (resp. is never a
surjection).

C) if f ∈ (A → B), f injective, then
∀Z ⊆ A, f̂ ∈ (Z → B), f = ι_((Z → A)) ∘ f̂, we have that f̂ is also an
injection. However, one can construct Z ⊆ A such that f stops being a
surjection.

D) if f ∈ (A → B), f surjective, then
∀Z ⊇ A, f̂ ∈ (Z → (B ∪ f(Z))), f = ι_((Z → A)) ∘ f̂, we have that f̂ is
also a surjection. However, one can construct Z ⊆ A such that f stops
being a injection.
