{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs36 Group Weekly Reports\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 1 : Today we mostly talked about the first chapter first section\u8217's reading; going over the vocabulary term by term (see the lexicon on the github repo), and going more in depth over certain concepts (particularly relating to set relations). We also saw a bit of a "teaser" of how these notions are used. We did not go over the exercises since not everyone had done them.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 2 : Today we continued on discussing the first chapter, it was mostly freeform. We mostly talked about foundations of set theory (mostly stemming from the discussion of exercise 1 on russell\u8217's paradox), why we use function notation the way we do, and about some of the operators over sets themselves (including through some examples from linear algebra and things like the subobject classifier which is seen at the end of section 3).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 3 : Today we finished discussing the first chapter. We went over all exercises. We mostly spoke about equivalence relations and partitions. We also spoke about the geometry/topology of quotients of sets by equivalence relations. This was naturally related to exercises 1.2 to 1.7.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 4 : We went over monomorphisms and epimorphisms in more depth. We corrected exercises 2.1 to 2.3 (included)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 5 : We went in depth over the distinction between isomorphisms and bijections (foreshadowing a bunch of category theory while we were at it) and corrected exercises 2.4 and 2.5.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 6 : We went in depth over the notion of section. We corrected exercises 2.6 and 2.7. For the latter exercise, we understood Tristan\u8217's solution by ourselves ! (written by Amric)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 7 : We reviewed the notions of algebraic quotient and well-definition. We broached the notion of universal property. We used this to correct exercises 2.8 and 2.9.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 8 : We corrected exercises 2.10 and 2.11. We then did some preliminary explanations to present categories and help with the reading of section 3.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 9 : We spoke more in depth about category theory, concrete categories, local smallness, algebraic structures (and their vocabulary) and applied category theory.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Week 10 : We reviewed examples 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and gave a bunch of disambiguation ideas for 3.5. Next week we\u8217'll go over 3.5 and 3.6 in a bit more detail, and start correcting the exercises for this section. We\u8217'll leave 3.7 and above for when we get to their respective exercises\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In a nutshell, Russell\u8217's paradox proves, by contradiction, that certain mathematical collections cannot be sets. It posits the existence of a "set of all sets that don\u8217't contain themselves". Such a set can neither contain itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that does contain itself", and should be excluded); nor can it exclude it itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that doesn\u8217't contain itself", and should be included).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs24 1.2)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Prove that any equivalence relation over a set {\i S} defines a partition of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 a) \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} has no empty elements: any element in {\i S} is part of at least one equivalence class, the class containing at least that element itself. Since there is no equivalence class constructed independently from elements, there are no empty equivalence classes.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 b) Elements of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} are disjoint: suppose there is an element {\i x} that is part of {\i A} and {\i B}, two distinct equivalence classes. \u8704?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a} and \u8704?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i B},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}. By transivity through {\i x}, \u8704?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?\u8704?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i B},\u8198?{\i a}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}. Therefore, {\i A} and {\i B} are the same equivalence class: {\i A}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i B}. Contradiction. Therefore all elements of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} are disjoint subsets of {\i S}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 c) The union of all elements of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} makes up {\i S}: suppose \u8707?{\i x}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S} such that {\i x}\u8196?\u8713?\u8196?\u8899?{\sub {\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}}}{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}. From the argument made in (a), {\i x} exists in at least one equivalence class, the class which contains only {\i x} itself. This is one of ou {\i S}{\sub {\i i}} sets. Contradiction. Therefore, \u8899?{\sub {\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}}}{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The insight here is to build an equivalence relation such that two elements are equivalent if and only if they are part of the same subset of {\i S}, which is understood as their common equivalence class.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We define \u8764? such that \u8704?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?,\u8198?\u8704?{\i x}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?\u8704?{\i y}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i y}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 c) Transitivity:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 $$\\begin\{aligned\}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 How many different equivalence relations may be defined on the set \{1,\u8198?2,\u8198?3\}?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If we start with the 1 element set, we have only one possible partition, one possible equivalence class.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 With the 2 element set, there are 2 partitions, \{\{1,\u8198?2\}\} and \{\{1\},\u8198?\{2\}\}.\par}

Eg, 4.76\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?1024.76\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?5.34, since \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?5.34\u8197?+\u8197?10\u8196?=\u8196?4.76, etc.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 To make an algebraic quotient of a set by an equivalence relation, we take the function which maps each element to its corresponding equivalence class, in the set (partition) containing these equivalence class. Intuitively, this is similar to keeping only one representative element per equivalence class. For the example class above, we can keep the representative 0.76. There is such an equivalence class for every fractional part possible, that is, one for every number in [0,\u8198?1[. The corresponding map is the "real remainder of division modulo 1". This map is well-defined because each real number has only one output for this map, and all real numbers that are equivalent through \u8764? are mapped to the same value in the output set.\par}

This boils down to combining two such loops from the first part of the exercise: one in the {\i x} direction and one in the {\i y} direction: what this gives is the small square [0,\u8198?1[\u8197?\u215?\u8197?[0,\u8198?1[, which loops to {\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?0 (resp. {\i y}\u8196?=\u8196?0) when {\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?1 (resp. {\i y}\u8196?=\u8196?1) is reached.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Can we define a category in the style of Example 3.3, using the relation < on the set \u8484? ?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 (Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Naively, saying like in example 3.3 "there is a singleton homset Hom({\i a},\u8198?{\i b}) each time we have {\i a}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i b}", we cannot define such a category, since < is not reflexive, and we would thus lack identity morphisms.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 However, in a roundabout way, we can define a category over the {\i negation} of <: "there is a singleton homset Hom({\i a},\u8198?{\i b}) each time we DO NOT have {\i a}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i b}". Namely this corresponds to the relation \u8805?, which is, itself, reflexive, transitive (and antisymmetric), and is a valid instance of the kind of category presented in example 3.3.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In fact, the pair (\u8484?,\u8198?\u8196?\u8805?\u8196?) is an instance of what is called a "totally ordered set", which is a more restrictive kind of "partially ordered set" (also called "poset" for short). Consequently, this kind of category is called a "poset category".\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 (Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Example 3.4 describes a category {\i S\u770?} where the objects are the subsets of a set {\i S} (equivalently: elements of the powerset \u55349?\u56491?({\i S}) of {\i S}), and morphisms between two subsets {\i A} and {\i B} of {\i S} are singleton (or empty) homsets based on whether the inclusion is true (or false).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Inclusion of sets, \u8834?, is also an order relation, this time between the elements of a set of sets (here, \u55349?\u56491?({\i S})). This means inclusion is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. This makes {\i S\u770?} a poset category, and thus another instance of example 3.3.\par}

(I will leave the reader the task to make sense of a matrix with 0 rows or columns.) Use product of matrices to define composition. Does this category \u8217'feel\u8217' familiar ?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The formulation of the exercise is strange. It says to use the product of matrices to define composition, and to have homsets be sets of matrices, but objects of the category are supposed to be integers. I don\u8217't know of any matrix with real entries that maps an integer to an integer in this way.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We thus infer that the meaning of the exercise can be one of two things.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Either we suppose the set of objects could rather be understood as "something isomorphic to \u8469?", ie, the collection of real vector spaces with finite bases (ie, \u8704?{\i n}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8469?,\u8198?\u8477?{\super {\i n}}). In which case, this is just the category of real vector spaces with finite basis (and linear maps as morphisms), which is a subcategory of the category real vector spaces (commonly called {\i V}{\i e}{\i c}{\i t}{\sub \u8477?}). In this context, any morphism starting from 0\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?\u8477?{\super 0}\u8196?=\u8196?\{0\} is just the injection of the origin into the codomain; and any morphism ending at 0 is the mapping of all elements to the origin.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Otherwise, we understand this as "yes, the objects of the category are integers: this means you should ignore the actual content of the matrices, and instead consider only their effect on the dimensionality of domains and codomains". In this case, this category is a complete directed graph over \u8469? where each edge corresponds to the change in dimension (from domain to codomain) caused by a given linear map.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs20 3.7.1) Slice categories\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Slice categories are categories made by singling out an object (say {\i A}) in some parent (larger) category (say \u55349?\u56478?), and studying all morphisms into that object. These morphisms become the objects of a new category (ie, for any {\i Z} of \u55349?\u56478?, {\i f}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}) is an object of the slice category, called \u55349?\u56478?{\sub {\i A}} in this context). In the slice category, morphisms are defined as those morphism in \u55349?\u56478? that preserve composition between 2 morphisms into {\i A}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Note that there exist pairs of morphisms {\i f}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}) and {\i f}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}) between which there is no morphism that exists in the slice category. One such example we can make is in ({\i V}{\i e}{\i c}{\i t}{\sub \u8477?}){\sub \u8477?{\super 2}} (see notes "On the morphisms of slice and coslice categories" for more details).\par}

Also, since the only maps post-{\i f} are maps from {\i A}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}, we have {\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}} as the (post-/left-)unit for every morphism {\i f} (ie, {\i f}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i f}.\par}

As for morphisms in {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, we can consider that for any multisets {\i A}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?* and {\i B}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?*, the homset from {\i A} to {\i B} is simply the set functions from {\i S}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?* to {\i S}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?* as usual.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We first notice that if we restrict {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} to only the objects for which all elements have a count of 1, and where morphisms only ever output to \{1\} in the second coordinate (a subcategory we can call {\b C}{\b 1}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, for example), we get a "copy" of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t}: {\b C}{\b 1}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} and {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} are isomorphic in {\b C}{\b a}{\b t}. This is a full subcategory because there are no morphisms that map counts to anything else than \{1\} if we restrict our objects to this form; so all morphisms between the kept objects are also kept.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Now let us do a similar construction, but based on equivalence classes instead. We know that each equivalence class over a set corresponds uniquely to a partition of that set. By considering only these partitions (these "sets of sets") as objects, we can build a category {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} (for "equivalence multiset"). The "count" corresponds simply to the cardinal of a top-level element in the partition. For example, the top-level elements of {\i M}\u8196?=\u8196?\{{\i S}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub 3}\}\u8196?=\u8196?\{\{{\i a}\},\u8198?\{{\i b},\u8198?{\i c}\},\u8198?\{{\i d},\u8198?{\i e},\u8198?{\i f}\}\} would be understood to have counts |{\i S}{\sub 1}|\u8196?=\u8196?1, |{\i S}{\sub 2}|\u8196?=\u8196?2 and |{\i S}{\sub 3}|\u8196?=\u8196?3 respectively.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 As for morphisms in {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, they simply map each top-level element of the domain multiset (a distinct subset of the original set) to some other top-level elements in the codomain multiset. This has precisely the same effect as mapping pairs of "value and count" as seen in the previous {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} construction.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In this example, any set itself, when "injected" (by a functor) into {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} would just nest all of its elements into singletons. I.e., {\i S}\u8196?=\u8196?\{{\i a},\u8198?{\i b},\u8198?{\i c}\} in {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} would become {\i S}\u8196?=\u8196?\{\{{\i a}\},\u8198?\{{\i b}\},\u8198?\{{\i c}\}\} in {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}. This also shows how restricting {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} to "only objects that are a set of (toplevel) singletons" makes {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} have a "copy" of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} as a full subcategory (for similar arguments as above).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Yet another example could be something akin to polynomials with integer coefficients on freeform indeterminates of degree 1 (which would be our set elements); raising the operators one rank, a product of freeform variables with integer powers (multiplicities), etc.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since the objects of a category \u55349?\u56478? are not (necessarily) sets, it is not clear how to make sense of a notion of \u8217'subobject\u8217' in general.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Composition is defined for {\i two} morphisms. If more than 2 morphisms are given, one may compose them in several ways, so that every step only consists in composing 2 morphisms. Prove that for any such valid sequence of morphisms, the order of parentheses doesn\u8217't matter.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This boils down to showing that associativity is a global property, that doesn\u8217't just make parentheses meaningless when there are 3 elements and 2 operators between them, but in general {\i n} elements with ({\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1) operators between them.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Note: A useful way of visualizing this is representing the order of operations as a binary tree, and noticing that applying associativity (forwards or backwards) is just a tree rotation (resp. right or left) at a given node. Then it is easy to show that one can always obtain a "left comb binary tree". Since every choice of parentheses is equal to this left comb choice, and equality is transitive, every choice of parentheses is equal to every other choice.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 To be more rigorous, we will proceed by induction.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Hypothesis: {\i P}({\i n}) = "for a given {\i n}, for {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1} any valid, composable, ordered sequence of morphisms in our base category \u55349?\u56478?, any choice {\i H} of parentheses to compose elements of this sequence 2-by-2, giving a formula {\i s}{\sub {\i H}}, will lead to the same result, which can be seen by always having {\i s}{\sub {\i H}}\u8196?=\u8196?(\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?({\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1})\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?){\i f}{\sub 1}".\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Initialization: We initialize at {\i n}\u8196?=\u8196?3; the validity is immediate as it is precisely the definition of associativity.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Heredity: We suppose the hypothesis {\i P}({\i n}) true for a given {\i n}\u8196?\u8805?\u8196?3; let us show that this implies that the hypothesis is true for {\i P}({\i n}\u8197?+\u8197?1).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 What this means is that, no matter the composable ordered sequence {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1} of {\i n} functions, for a fixed {\i n}, the order of parentheses does not matter. Note that though {\i n} is chosen and fixed; the statement is true for EVERY (ordered, composable) sequence of functions. We add a new function {\i g} to this sequence. By a simple renaming of the functions, we deduce that it doesn\u8217't matter where we insert {\i g}, so we\u8217'll insert it at the very right to simplify our argument, giving us the sequence {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1}{\i g}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Here, there are 3 cases. Either:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i g} is part of the last composition (i.e., it\u8217's not in a semantically necessary parenthethical grouping; it can be made external to all parentheses),\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i g} is part of the first composition (i.e., the first operation is ({\i f}{\sub 1}{\i g}))\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab it isn\u8217't either (it\u8217's inside some non-removable parentheses, and needs to be composed earlier on, but not as the first operation).\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If {\i g} is part of the last composition, then by applying the hypothesis {\i P}({\i n}) to the terms {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1}, we immediately find that our new sequence can be made equal to ((\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?({\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1})\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?){\i f}{\sub 1}){\i g}, which is precisely what we wanted for {\i P}({\i n}\u8197?+\u8197?1).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If {\i g} is part of the first composition, we isolate it so that it isn\u8217't anymore. To do so, we apply "backwards" associativity on the grouping of terms {\i F}{\sub {\i k}}({\i f}{\sub 1}{\i g}) in order to obtain ({\i F}{\sub {\i k}}{\i f}{\sub 1}){\i g}, where {\i F}{\sub {\i k}} is the appropriate choice of ({\i f}{\sub {\i k}}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 2}) such that associativity can be applied (with 2\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i k}\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i n}). This makes it so that our problem is identical to our final case, solved just below.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If {\i g} is part of neither the first nor last composition, then we consider the innermost composition ({\i f}{\sub {\i k}}{\i f}{\sub {\i k}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}) to be a single element {\i h}. We now have a sequence of only {\i n} terms. We apply our hypothesis {\i P}({\i n}). This makes {\i g} the outermost right term, part of the last composition. Unravelling {\i h} back into two members, we see that we are back at our initial case, with an arbitrary order of parentheses for the {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1} terms, and {\i g} outermost. We already saw that this implied {\i P}({\i n}\u8197?+\u8197?1).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Conclusion: since we have initialization and heredity of our hypothesis in all cases, we can conclude by induction that it is true for all {\i n}\u8196?\u8805?\u8196?3.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In Example 3.3 we have seen how to construct a category from a set endowed with a relation, provided the latter is reflexive and transitive. For what types of relations is the corresponding category a groupoid (cf. Example 4.6) ?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We remind example 4.6 : a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. This means that every morphism needs to be 2-way invertible.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In this context, this means that for every morphism {\i a}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}, there should be a corresponding inverse morphism {\i b}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a}. This property is precisely the symmetry of a relation.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Initiality: we take an arbitrary set {\i Z} in {\b Set}. We wish to study $Hom_\{\\text\{\\textbf\{Set\}\}\}(\\emptyset, Z) = Z^\\emptyset$. We recall that functions (in category theory) are defined as "applications" / "mappings" are in traditional set theory (i.e., as a relation between sets where every antecedent in the domain has a singleton image in the codomain; the key point being that "no input has no result when passed through the function"). Let {\i I} be an initial element in {\b Set}. We write |{\i I}|\u8196?=\u8196?{\i n} and |{\i Z}|\u8196?=\u8196?{\i m}. We know that |{\i Z}{\super {\i I}}|\u8196?=\u8196?|{\i Z}|{\super |{\i I}|}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i m}{\super {\i n}}. For {\i I} to be initial, this is true if and only if {\i m}{\super {\i n}}\u8196?=\u8196?1 for all {\i m}, and so if and only if {\i n}\u8196?=\u8196?0. We recall that the empty set is the only set with |\u8709?|\u8196?=\u8196?0, therefore {\i I}\u8196?=\u8196?\u8709?.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Now this is already enough to prove unicity, but let us spell it out for pedagogy\u8217's sake.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Unicity: We recall that two objects of {\b Set} are isomorphic if, and only if, there exists a bijection between them. This is equivalent to saying that two sets have the same cardinal. We once again recall that the empty set is the only set with |\u8709?|\u8196?=\u8196?0; there are no bijections relating to the empty set, other than its identity, the unique morphism in $Hom_\{\\text\{\\textbf\{Set\}\}\}(\\emptyset, \\emptyset)$ . Using proposition 5.4 (that terminal objects are unique up-to-isomorphism), we finally deduce that \u8709? is the unique initial object in {\b Set}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 NB: the unique function in {\i Z}{\super \u8709?} is always the empty function.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Prove that final objects are unique up to isomorphism.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let us suppose we have a category \u55349?\u56478? with two final objects, {\i F}{\sub 1} and {\i F}{\sub 2}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 For every object {\i A} of \u55349?\u56478? there is at least one element in {\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i A}), namely the identity 1{\sub {\i A}}. If {\i F} is final, then there is a unique morphism {\i F}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}, which therefore must be the identity 1{\sub {\i F}}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Now assume {\i F}{\sub 1} and {\i F}{\sub 2} are both final in \u55349?\u56478?. Since {\i F}{\sub 1} is final, there is a unique morphism {\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1} in \u55349?\u56478?. Since {\i F}{\sub 2} is final, there is a unique morphism {\i g}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 2} in \u55349?\u56478?. Consider {\i g}{\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1} ; as observed, necessarily {\i g}{\i f}\u8196?=\u8196?1{\sub {\i F}{\sub 2}} since {\i F}{\sub 1} is final. By the same token {\i f}{\i g}\u8196?=\u8196?1{\i F}{\sub 1}, proving {\i f} is an isomorphism. Thus {\i F}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 2}.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 What are initial and final objects in the category of "pointed sets" (Example 3.8)? Are they unique?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We recall that a pointed set is just a regular set with a special, identified point, and that the category of pointed sets {\b Set*} is built upon the same objects as {\b Set}, but where each object {\i A} in {\b Set} is multiplied into |{\i A}| copies of itself in {\b Set*} (one for each choice of special point; this implies that the empty set is not a part of {\b Set*}, since it has no point). Morphisms in {\b Set*} are set functions, but with the restriction of mapping the special point in the domain to the special point in the codomain.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Given this information, we will prove that the initial and final objects in {\b Set*} are the singleton sets.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let ({\i O},\u8198?{\i o}) be a singleton set in {\b Set*}. Let {\i o} be the single element of {\i O}; it is necessarily also the special point, as there is no other choice. For any codomain ({\i Z},\u8198?{\i z}{\sub 0}) in {\b Set*}, the condition that "special points map to special points" restricts our choice of function to the unique function ({\i o},\u8198?{\i z}{\sub 0}), thus, {\i O} is initial. If {\i O} had more than one element, there would exist some {\i Z} (non-singletons) for which the other element would allow another degree of freedom (and thus {\i O} would not be initial).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Similarly, now studying {\i Z} as a domain and {\i O} as a codomain, we see that that only function from {\i Z} to {\i O} is (like in {\b Set}) the function which maps everything (including {\i Z}\u8217's special point) to {\i o}. Thus, {\i O} is final. If {\i O} had more than one element, there would similarly be many choices for any {\i Z} of cardinal \u8196?\u8805?\u8196?2, so long as the special point maps to the special point.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Every singleton pointed set is both initial and final in {\b Set*} and is thus a zero object. These are also the only such pointed sets.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 What are the final objects in the category considered in \u167?5.3?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The category considered in paragraph 5.3 is the coslice category over some set {\i A}. However, what is presented in this paragraph is some extra structure that arises when considering the statement "The quotient {\i A}/\u8764? is universal with respect to the property of mapping {\i A} to a set in such a way that equivalent elements have the same image". We thus give some equivalence relation \u8764? on {\i A} and study the quotient set {\i A}/\u8764? in the general coslice category; to do this, we consider the subcategory \u55349?\u56492? of \u55349?\u56478?{\sub {\i A}} where only {\i \u966?} such that "equivalence is preserved" (i.e., such that \u8704?{\i a}\u8242?,\u8198?{\i a}\u8243?\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?{\i a}\u8242?\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a}\u8243?\u8196?\u8658?\u8196?{\i \u966?}({\i a}\u8242?)\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u966?}({\i a}\u8243?)).\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The following diagram commutes, and summarizes the situation.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Objects in this category are denoted as ({\i \u966?},\u8198?{\i Z}) and are obtained from what used to be {\i morphisms} (regular functions) in {\b Set}. Morphisms are mappings {\i \u963?}{\sub \u55349?\u56492?}\u8196?:\u8196?({\i \u966?}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i Z}{\sub 1})\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?({\i \u966?}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i Z}{\sub 2}) such that one exists if and only if \u8707?{\i \u963?}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i Z}{\sub 2}),\u8198?{\i \u963?}{\i \u966?}{\sub 1}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u966?}{\sub 2}, and \u8704?{\i a}\u8242?,\u8198?{\i a}\u8243?\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?{\i a}\u8242?\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a}\u8243?\u8196?\u8658?\u8196?{\i \u966?}({\i a}\u8242?)\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u966?}({\i a}\u8243?).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since the textbook also asks whether such a category has initial objects, we will first also answer this and consider all terminal objects.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The initial object of a general coslice category is {\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}}. This is easily verified by doing {\i \u966?}{\sub 1}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}}, necessarily {\i \u963?}{\i \u966?}{\sub 1}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u963?}{\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u963?}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u966?}{\sub 2}, and so {\i \u963?} always exists and is unique. We also see that this object satisfies the "equivalence preservation" condition, hence it exists in \u55349?\u56492?, and is also the initial object in \u55349?\u56492?.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 A general coslice category has a final object ({\i t},\u8198?{\i F}) (or many final objects ({\i t}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?{\i F}{\sub {\i i}})) iff \u55349?\u56478? has a final object {\i F} (or many final objects {\i F}{\sub {\i i}}). In that case, any final object ({\i t},\u8198?{\i F}) in \u55349?\u56478?{\sub {\i A}} corresponds to the unique morphism from {\i A} to {\i F} (for any final {\i F}) in \u55349?\u56478?. Let us verify this.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let {\i F} be final in \u55349?\u56478?, and {\i t} be the unique morphism {\i t}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i F}). Let ({\i \u966?},\u8198?{\i Z}) be an arbitrary object of \u55349?\u56478?{\sub {\i A}}. Let be {\i \u963?} such that {\i \u963?}{\i \u966?}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i t}. We consider the following diagram:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since {\i F} is final in \u55349?\u56478?, {\i \u963?} is unique and always exists. Also, since {\i \u963?} is unique and always exist, the choice of {\i \u966?} is irrelevant: this same {\i \u963?} works for all choices of {\i \u966?} for a given arbitrary {\i Z}. This proves that {\i \u963?}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?{\sub {\i A}}} exists and is unique for all ({\i \u966?},\u8198?{\i Z}). Finally, since {\i \u963?} works for all choices of {\i \u966?}, it works for those that satisfy the "equivalence preservation" condition, and so does {\i t}: this means that ({\i t},\u8198?{\i F}) is indeed a final object in \u55349?\u56492?.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 First, we remind the universal property for quotients.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We first apply the universal property of products to obtain the following commutative diagram:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We now consider a well-defined map {\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i Z} (i.e., {\i f}({\i a}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 1})\u8196?=\u8196?{\i f}({\i a}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 2}) whenever ({\i a}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 1})\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?({\i a}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 2})).

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Therefore, using the maps {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i p}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}/\u8764?{\sub {\i A}} and {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i B}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i p}{\sub {\i B}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i B}/\u8764?{\sub {\i B}}, we can "quotient through" (i.e., use the universal property of quotient) ({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})/\u8764?.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The internal parts of the diagram (except {\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i h}{\sub {\i B}} which are arbitrary, all other arrows are unique morphisms) force {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} to commute with the rest of the diagram: any pairs of maps {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} that make the diagram commute must necessarily be constrained by the existing morphisms (as the composition of unique morphisms). Any choice of maps {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} must respect {\i g}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i h}{\sub {\i B}}, for corresponding arbitrary (but inferred) {\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i h}{\sub {\i B}}; said otherwise, maps {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} in this configuration can only exist if they make the diagram commute.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In the case of $\\empty$ as the input set, and there is only one function $f: \\empty \\to Z$ for any {\i Z}: {\i f} is the empty mapping.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Similarly, in the case of the (unique up-to-isomorphism) singleton set \{\u8197?\u8902?\u8197?\} as the output, you\u8217'd have multiple functions (precisely 2{\super |{\i Z}|}) into it, if you could ignore some elements of the input set. However, if all elements of the input set are required, that leaves you with only one function possible from {\i Z}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?\{\u8197?\u8902?\u8197?\}: the function which maps all elements to \u8902?.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In the first example, what causes the issue is the fact that the images of {\i f}{\sub 1} and {\i f}{\sub 2} in {\i A} are distinct.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In the second example, what causes the issue is the fact that we\u8217've reduced our common domain {\i A} to an insufficient intermediary object {\i Z}{\sub 1}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The "element which isn\u8217't mapped to offers a degree of freedom and thus breaks unicity" in the last example should remind you of the notes on surjections. Indeed, when comparing {\i \u963?}{\sub {\i \u945?}} and {\i \u963?}{\sub {\i \u946?}}, we\u8217're in a context which is reminiscent of the definition of an epimorphism.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We can be assured of being able to cancel {\i \u966?}1 iff {\i \u966?}{\sub 1} is an epimorphism, and thus {\i \u963?}, if it exists, is unique. The proof for slice categories is similar, but given the reverse orders, uses monomorphisms.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Then: "The declaration/explanation of a universal property generally follows the pattern \u8217'object X is universal with respect to the following property: for any Y such that..., there exists a unique morphism Y \u8594? X such that...\u8217'; this explanation hides the de\u64257?nition of an accessory category, and the statement that X is terminal."\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This is a complicated way to say: there is some construct to decompose a morphism which is "universal" (always exists) and reduces the rest of the information of the morphism into something "unique" (hence terminal object of some subcategory).\par}
