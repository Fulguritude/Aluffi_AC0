Group Weekly Reports

Week 1 : Today we mostly talked about the first chapter first section’s
reading; going over the vocabulary term by term (see the lexicon on the
github repo), and going more in depth over certain concepts
(particularly relating to set relations). We also saw a bit of a
"teaser" of how these notions are used. We did not go over the exercises
since not everyone had done them.

Week 2 : Today we continued on discussing the first chapter, it was
mostly freeform. We mostly talked about foundations of set theory
(mostly stemming from the discussion of exercise 1 on russell’s
paradox), why we use function notation the way we do, and about some of
the operators over sets themselves (including through some examples from
linear algebra and things like the subobject classifier which is seen at
the end of section 3).

Week 3 : Today we finished discussing the first chapter. We went over
all exercises. We mostly spoke about equivalence relations and
partitions. We also spoke about the geometry/topology of quotients of
sets by equivalence relations. This was naturally related to exercises
1.2 to 1.7.

Week 4 : We went over monomorphisms and epimorphisms in more depth. We
corrected exercises 2.1 to 2.3 (included)

Week 5 : We went in depth over the distinction between isomorphisms and
bijections (foreshadowing a bunch of category theory while we were at
it) and corrected exercises 2.4 and 2.5.

Week 6 : We went in depth over the notion of section. We corrected
exercises 2.6 and 2.7. For the latter exercise, we understood Tristan’s
solution by ourselves ! (written by Amric)

Week 7 : We reviewed the notions of algebraic quotient and
well-definition. We broached the notion of universal property. We used
this to correct exercises 2.8 and 2.9.

Week 8 : We corrected exercises 2.10 and 2.11. We then did some
preliminary explanations to present categories and help with the reading
of section 3.

Week 9 : We spoke more in depth about category theory, concrete
categories, local smallness, algebraic structures (and their vocabulary)
and applied category theory.

Week 10 : We reviewed examples 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 and gave a bunch of
disambiguation ideas for 3.5. Next week we’ll go over 3.5 and 3.6 in a
bit more detail, and start correcting the exercises for this section.
We’ll leave 3.7 and above for when we get to their respective exercises

Week 11 : This week we went over examples 3.5 and 3.6 in a lot more
detail, made our own "concrete" example (for 3.6). Next week we’ll start
correcting exercises, since examples 3.7 and above have their own
exercises.

Week 12 : This week we went over exercises 3.1 to 3.5 (included). We
also saw a concrete example of duality (matrix/vector transposition). We
also spoke a little about things that Tristan has learned from working
on section 5 (comma categories and the formalization of diagrams). Next
week (or in 2 weeks) we’ll continue correcting the exercises, including
those on the various examples of comma categories.

Week 13 : Today we talked mostly about slice and coslice categories, as
well as subcategories, and corrected exercises 3.6, 3.7 and 3.8. For
next time, an "extra credit" exercise would be to translate the matrix
slice category "BONUS" example into a coslice category example (hint:
use transposition).

Week 14 : Today was mostly revisions. We again talked about slice and
coslice categories. We reviewed the examples and made things more
rigorous, as well as corrected some mistakes that had been lurking. We
also added Aluffi’s "example 3.8 concrete coslice" on pointed sets as an
example of a coslice category.

Week 15 : We finished the coslice category concrete example, and
corrected exercises 3.9 and 3.10.

Week 16 : We gave some examples of bislice, bicoslice, fibered bislice
and fibered bicoslice categories.

Week 17 : We moved on to section 4 and discussed in depth the
distinctions between monomorphisms and injections, as well as between
epimorphisms and surjections. We corrected exercise 4.3 along the way.

Week 18 : We corrected exercises 4.1 and 4.2 and went over 4.3 again.

Week 19 : This week, since a couple of members were absent, we did a
quick tour of sections one and two for our new member, while working on
a summary lexicon for these sections.

Week 20 : [Last] week we did some reviews, and improved the lexicon,
mostly concerning section 3.

Week 21 : This week we spoke about universal properties, initial
elements and final elements (terminal elements) and how these latter
ones are useful to define universal properties.

Week 22 : Last week (july 2nd) we spoke about quotient spaces and how
quotients respect a universal property.

Week 23 : This week (july 9th) we went over the universal property of
products and the universal property of coproducts in Set with concrete
examples. Next week we’ll start correcting the exercises.

Week 24 : This week we corrected exercises 5.1 to 5.4.

Week 25 : This week we corrected exercise 5.5, and reviewed slices,
coslices, initial and final objects for in order to solve it.

Week 26 : Today we completed exercise 5.6.

Week 27 : Today we worked on exercise 5.7 but got confused.

Week 28 : Today we kind’a gave up on 5.7, but solved 5.8.

Week 29 : Today we solved 5.9 and 5.10.

Week 30 : Today we solved 5.11 and discussed approaches for 5.12.

Week 31 : Today we solves 5.12, and with it, completed Chapter 1.

Week 32: Talked about groups, groupoids and orders

Week 33: Talked about groups, orders and lattices, and solved exercise
II.1.1

Week 34: Solved exercises 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5 and 1.6 up to (including)
order 3

Week 35: Finished exercise 1.6 and talked about homotopy and whatnot. We
cut it short since some had left and others were falling asleep.

Week 36: today we corrected 1.7 to 1.11 (included)

Week 37: Today we corrected exercises II.1.12 to II.1.14 (included).
We’re thinking of skipping II.1.15 next week, and going straight to
reading section II.2

Chapter I)

Section 1)

1.1)

In a nutshell, Russell’s paradox proves, by contradiction, that certain
mathematical collections cannot be sets. It posits the existence of a
"set of all sets that don’t contain themselves". Such a set can neither
contain itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that does contain
itself", and should be excluded); nor can it exclude it itself (since in
that case, it would be a "set that doesn’t contain itself", and should
be included).

1.2)

Prove that any equivalence relation over a set S defines a partition of
𝒫_(S).

a) 𝒫_(S) has no empty elements: any element in S is part of at least one
equivalence class, the class containing at least that element itself.
Since there is no equivalence class constructed independently from
elements, there are no empty equivalence classes.

b) Elements of 𝒫_(S) are disjoint: suppose there is an element x that is
part of A and B, two distinct equivalence classes. ∀a ∈ A, x ∼ a and
∀b ∈ B, x ∼ b. By transivity through x, ∀a ∈ A, ∀b ∈ B, a ∼ b.
Therefore, A and B are the same equivalence class: A = B. Contradiction.
Therefore all elements of 𝒫_(S) are disjoint subsets of S.

c) The union of all elements of 𝒫_(S) makes up S: suppose ∃x ∈ S such
that x ∉ ⋃_(S_(i) ∈ 𝒫_(S))S_(i). From the argument made in (a), x exists
in at least one equivalence class, the class which contains only x
itself. This is one of ou S_(i) sets. Contradiction. Therefore,
⋃_(S_(i) ∈ 𝒫_(S))S_(i) = S

1.3)

Given a partition 𝒫 on a set S, show how to define a relation ∼ on S
such that P is the corresponding partition.

The insight here is to build an equivalence relation such that two
elements are equivalent if and only if they are part of the same subset
of S, which is understood as their common equivalence class.

We define ∼ such that
∀S_(i), S_(j) ∈ 𝒫, ∀x ∈ S_(i), ∀y ∈ S_(j), x ∼ y ⇔ S_(i) = S_(j).

Let us prove that ∼ is an equivalence relation.

a) Reflexivity:
∀A ∈ 𝒫, ∀x ∈ A, A = A ⇒ x ∼ x

b) Symmetry:
∀S_(i), S_(j) ∈ 𝒫, ∀x ∈ S_(i), ∀y ∈ S_(j), x ∼ y ⇔ S_(i) = S_(j) ⇔ S_(j) = S_(i) ⇔ y ∼ x

c) Transitivity:

$$\begin{aligned}
\forall S_i, S_j, S_k \in \mathcal{P}, \forall x \in S_i, \forall y \in S_j, \forall z \in S_k, \\
(x \sim y) \cap (y \sim z) \\
    \Leftrightarrow \\
(S_i = S_j) \cap (S_j = S_k) \\
    \Rightarrow \\
S_i = S_k \\
    \Leftrightarrow \\
x \sim z
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, ∼ is indeed an equivalence relation, and is generated
uniquely by the partition.

1.4)

How many different equivalence relations may be defined on the set
{1, 2, 3}?

If we start with the 1 element set, we have only one possible partition,
one possible equivalence class.

With the 2 element set, there are 2 partitions, {{1, 2}} and {{1}, {2}}.

With the 3 element set, there is:

-   1 partition of type 1-1-1: {{1}, {2}, {3}}.

-   3 partitions of type 2-1: {{1}, {2, 3}}, {{2}, {1, 3}}, and
    {{3}, {1, 2}}.

-   1 partition of type 3: {{1, 2, 3}}.

Hence, there are five equivalence classes on the 3 element set.

See the Bell numbers: https://oeis.org/A000110

1.5)

Give an example of a relation that is reflexive and symmetric, but not
transitive. What happens if you attempt to use this relation to define a
partition on the set?

Let’s imagine a "similarity relation" we can notate with ≃. We can
imagine it to work like a looser version of equality (say for example,
if an integer is only 1 away, then it counts as similar).

-   reflexive: ∀a ∈ S, a ≃ a (an element is always "similar" to itself)

-   symmetric: ∀a, b ∈ S, a ≃ b ⇒ b ≃ a ("similarity" goes both ways)

-   not transitive: ∃a, b, c ∈ S, (a ≃ b) ∧ (b ≃ c) ∧ ¬(a ≃ c) (just
    because a ≃ b and b ≃ c are similar, that doesn’t mean a ≃ c works,
    because it is possible for the "similarity gap" to be too large to
    qualify as "similar". E.g.: (a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3).).

If we use this to define a partition P on some set S: S/ ≃  := P_(≃),
there is ambiguity as to which element should go into which equivalence
class.

This idea deserves further discussion.

In terms of graph theory, if we express a set with an internal relation
as a graph, we can represent elements as nodes and relationships as
edges. Reflexivity means that every node has a loop (unary, self-edge).
Symmetry means that the graph is not directed (since every relationship
goes both ways). Transitivity means that every connected subset of nodes
is a maximal clique (synonymously, every connected component is a
complete subgraph).

In a relation which is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive, you
would have connected components of this graph which are not cliques. For
these, there is ambiguity as to how you would group their nodes. Two
obvious choices would be either:

-   to remove the minimal number of edges to obtain n distinct cliques
    (thereby gaining the transitive restriction of the relation) from a
    given non-clique; or

-   to complete the connected subgraph into a clique (thereby gaining
    the transitive closure of the relation).

1.6)

Define a relation ∼ on the set ℝ of real numbers, by setting
a ∼ b ⇔ b − a ∈ ℤ. Prove that this is an equivalence relation, and find
a ’compelling’ description for ℝ/∼. Do the same for the relation ≈ on
the plane ℝ × ℝ defined by declaring
(a₁, a₂) ≈ (b₁, b₂) ⇔ b₁ − a₁ ∈ ℤ and b₂ − a₂ ∈ ℤ.

TODO: forgot to prove that it’s an equivalence relation

b − a ∈ ℤ means that 2 real numbers differ by an integral amount. This
means that the equivalence relation algebraically describes the idea
that "with this relation, 2 real numbers are the same iff they have the
same fractional component x (or 1 − x for negative numbers)". Eg,
4.76 ∼ 1024.76 ∼  − 5.34, since  − 5.34 + 10 = 4.76, etc.

To make an algebraic quotient of a set by an equivalence relation, we
take the function which maps each element to its corresponding
equivalence class, in the set (partition) containing these equivalence
class. Intuitively, this is similar to keeping only one representative
element per equivalence class. For the example class above, we can keep
the representative 0.76. There is such an equivalence class for every
fractional part possible, that is, one for every number in [0, 1[. The
corresponding map is the "real remainder of division modulo 1". This map
is well-defined because each real number has only one output for this
map, and all real numbers that are equivalent through ∼ are mapped to
the same value in the output set.

We should also notice that since 0 ∼ 1, this space loops around on
itself. Intuitively, if you increase linearly in the input space ℝ, it
goes back to 0 after 0.9999999... in the output space. This output space
is thus a circle of perimeter 1.

Similarly, b₁ − a₁ ∈ ℤ and b₂ − a₂ ∈ ℤ means that 2 points in the 2D
plane are the same iff they differ in each coordinate by an integral
amount. This boils down to combining two such loops from the first part
of the exercise: one in the x direction and one in the y direction: what
this gives is the small square [0, 1[ × [0, 1[, which loops to x = 0
(resp. y = 0) when x = 1 (resp. y = 1) is reached. This space functions
like a small torus, of area 1.

Section 2)

2.1)

How many different bijections are there between a set S with n elements
and itself?

Any bijection is a choice of a pairs from 2 sets of the same size, where
each element is used only once, and each pair has one element from each
set. At first there are n choices in each set. We go through each
possible input element in order (no choice), for each one, we pick one
amongst n possibilities for an output.

There are then (n − 1) choice of output left, etc.

Ccl°: $\prod_{i=1}^{i=n} i = n!$

2.2)

Prove that a function has a right-inverse (pre-inverse) iff it is
surjective (can use AC).

Let f ∈ (A → B).

2.2.a) ⇒

Suppose that f has a right-inverse (pre-inverse). We have
∃g ∈ (B → A), f ∘ g = id_(B)

Suppose that f is not a surjection. This means ∃b ∈ B, ∄a ∈ A, b = f(a)

f(g(b)) = id_(B)(b) = b Necessarily, g(b) is such an a, so
∃a ∈ A, b = f(a). Contradiction.

Ccl°:: f is a surjection.

2.2.b) ⇐

Suppose that f is a surjection.

∀b ∈ B, ∃a ∈ A, b = f(a)

We will construct a pre-inverse for f.

The insight here is to realize that a surjection divides its input set
into a partition, where each 2-by-2 disjoint subset corresponds to
f^( − 1)({q}), for every q in the output set. More formally, each
"fiber" (preimage of a singleton) is a disjoint subset of the input set,
and the union of fibers is the input set itself. You can see this in the
following diagram:

(add diagram) 1234 to ab 1a 2a (fiber from a) 3b 4b (fiber from b)
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/157450/producing-a-diagram-showing-relations-between-sets
https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/79009/drawing-the-mapping-of-elements-for-sets-in-latex

Using AC, we select a single element from each such fiber. For each
q ∈ B, we name p_(q) ∈ f^( − 1)({q}) the chosen element. We define g as
g ∈ (B → A), g = (q ↦ p_(q)). With this, ∀b ∈ B, f ∘ g(b) = b, and so
f ∘ g = id_(A). Thus, f has a preinverse.

A summary of this idea: all surjection preinverses are simply a choice
of a representative for each fiber of the surjection as the output to
the respective singleton.

2.3)

Prove that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection, and that the
composition of two bijections is a bijection.

2.3.a)

Using the fact that a function is a bijection iff it has a two-sided
inverse (Corollary 2.2) we can see from this defining fact,
f ∈ (A → B) bijective  ⇔ ∃f^( − 1) ∈ (B → A), (f^( − 1) ∘ f = id_(A) and f ∘ f^( − 1) = id_(B))
that f is naturally f^( − 1)’s (unique) two-sided inverse, and so
f^( − 1) is also a bijection.

2.3.b)

Let be f ∈ (A → B), g ∈ (B → C), both bijective (hence with inverses in
the respective function spaces). Let h ∈ (A → C), h = g ∘ f and
h^( − 1) ∈ (C → A), h^( − 1) = f^( − 1) ∘ g^( − 1). We have:

$$\begin{aligned}
h^{-1} \circ h &= (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \circ (g \circ f) \\
               &=  f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}  \circ  g \circ f  \\
               &=  f^{-1} \circ          id_B    \circ f  \\
               &=  f^{-1} \circ                        f  \\
               &=  id_A
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
h \circ h^{-1} &= (g \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \\
               &=  g \circ f  \circ  f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}  \\
               &=  g \circ     id_B         \circ g^{-1}  \\
               &=  g \circ                        g^{-1}  \\
               &=  id_C
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore h and h^( − 1) are two-sided inverses of each other, and thus
bijections. From this we conclude that the composition of any two
bijections is also a bijection.

2.4)

Prove that ‘isomorphism’ is an equivalence relation (on any set of
sets).

2.4.a) Problem statement

Let 𝒜 be a set of sets. We define the relation ≃ between the elements of
𝒜 as the following:

∀X, Y ∈ 𝒜, X ≃ Y ⇔ there exists a bijection between X and Y

Let us show that ≃ is an equivalence relation.

2.4.b) Reflexivity

For any set A ∈ 𝒜, the identity mapping on A is a bijection. This means
that ∀A ∈ 𝒜, A ≃ A, ie, ≃ is reflexive.

2.4.c) Symmetry

$$\begin{aligned}
\forall X, Y \in \mathcal{A}, \; X \simeq Y & \Rightarrow \exists f      \in (X \to Y) \text{ bijective} \\
                                            & \Rightarrow \exists f^{-1} \in (Y \to X) \text{ bijective} \\
                                            & \Rightarrow Y \simeq X
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, ≃ is symmetric.

2.4.d) Transitivity

Let be X, Y, Z ∈ 𝒜. Suppose that X ≃ Y and Y ≃ Z. This means
∃f ∈ (X → Y), g ∈ (Y → Z), both bijections. Let be
h ∈ (X → Z), h = g ∘ f. h is also a bijection since the composition of
two bijections is also a bijection (exercise 2.3).

The existence of h implies X ≃ Z.

Therefore ≃ is transitive.

2.4.e) Conclusion

Isomorphism, ≃, is a relation on an arbitrary set (of sets) which is
always reflexive, symmetric and transitive. It is thus an equivalence
relation.

2.5)

Formulate a notion of epimorphism and prove that epimorphisms and
surjections are equivalent.

See "notes" file: section "Proofs of mono/inj and epi/surj equivalence".

2.6)

With notation as in Example 2.4, explain how any function f ∈ (A → B)
determines a section of π_(A).

A section is the preinverse of a surjection. Here, the surjection in
question is π_(A) the projection of A × B onto A.

Let f ∈ (A → B).

We now consider the function which maps an input a ∈ A of f to its
"geometric representation" (its coordinates in the enclosing space
A × B, corresponding to a point of the graph Γ_(f)).
f̂ ∈ (A → (A × B)), f̂ = ( a ↦ (a, f(a)) )
We notice that f̂(A) = Γ_(f).

Naturally, π_(A) ∘ f̂ = (a ↦ a) = id_(A), therefore, f̂ is a pre-inverse
(section) of π_(A).

This set of relationships can be expressed in the following commutative
diagram:

PS: see "On sections and fibers" in the "notes" file for a worked
example.

2.7)

Let f ∈ (A → B) be any function. Prove that the graph Γ_(f) of f is
isomorphic to A.

Using the elements from the previous exercise, we know that f̂ is
injective from A into A × B. This property is inherited to any
restriction of the codomain Z ⊆ A × B, and corresponding implied
restriction of the domain to Y = f̂^( − 1)(Z) ⊆ A. In particular, here,
Y = A and Z = Γ_(f) = f̂(A). We now consider
$\overline{f} \in (A \to \Gamma_f), \overline{f} = (a \mapsto \hat{f}(a))$.
We can see that $\overline{f}$ is injective from being a restriction of
an injective function to a smaller codomain. We also know that
$\overline{f}$ is surjective, since its domain is its image. Therefore,
$\overline{f}$ is a bijection. This means that A ≃ Γ_(f).

2.8)

Describe as explicitly as you can all terms in the canonical
decomposition of the function f ∈ (ℝ → ℂ) defined by f = (r ↦ e^(2πir)).
(This exercise matches one assigned previously, which one?)

Firstly, elements of ℝ are equivalent by this map (they have the same
output) if they vary by 1 from each other. This is a reference to the
equivalence relation ∼ in exercise 1.6. Therefore, we will use ℝ/∼  ≃ S¹
in our decomposition. Obviously, the map from (ℝ → ℝ/ ∼ ), which maps
each element of ℝ to respective their equivalence class is a surjection
(since there’s no empty equivalence class).

Secondly, as mentioned, we have a bijection f̃ between ℝ/∼ and S¹, the
circle group of unit complex numbers, namely f̃ = (x ↦ e^(2πix), where
each element x of ℝ/∼ can be understood to correspond to a (class
representative) value in the interval [0, 1[.

Finally, we do the canonical injection of S¹ into its superset ℂ.

2.9)

Show that if A ≃ A′ and B ≃ B′ , and further A ∩ B = ∅ and A′ ∩ B′ = ∅,
then A ∪ B ≃ A′ ∪ B′. Conclude that the operation A∐B (as described in
§1.4) is well-defined up to isomorphism.

We suppose the aforementioned.

Let f_(A) be a bijection from A → A′, and f_(B) be a bijection from
B → B′.

We define the following:

$$f \in (A \cup B \to A' \cup B'),
\text{ such that }
\begin{cases}
    \forall a \in A, \; f(a) = f_A(a) \\
    \forall b \in B, \; f(b) = f_B(b)
\end{cases}$$

This function is a well-defined function, since A ∩ B = ∅: every element
of the domain has one, and only one, possible image.

Similarly, we define:

$$g \in (A' \cup B' \to A \cup B),
\text{ such that }
\begin{cases}
    \forall a \in A', \; g(a) = f_A^{-1}(a) \\
    \forall b \in B', \; g(b) = f_B^{-1}(b)
\end{cases}$$

Similarly, because A′ ∩ B′ = ∅, g is well-defined.

Let us study g ∘ f. We have:
$$\begin{cases}
    \forall a \in A, \; g(f(a)) = f_A^{-1}(f_A(a)) = a \\
    \forall b \in B, \; g(f(b)) = f_B^{-1}(f_B(b)) = b
\end{cases}$$

Hence, g ∘ f = id_(A ∪ B). Similarly, f ∘ g = id_(A′ ∪ B′). Therefore,
g = f^( − 1), f is a bijection, and A ∪ B ≃ A′ ∪ B′.

We’ll now do a shift in notation. Let be some arbitrary sets A and B.
Let be A₁, A₂, B₁, B₂ such that A₁ = {1} × A, A₂ = {2} × A,
B₁ = {1} × B, and B₂ = {2} × B. This means A ≃ A₁, A ≃ A₂, B ≃ B₁, and
B ≃ B₂. It also means A₁ ∩ A₂ = ∅ and B₁ ∩ B₂ = ∅. From the above, this
implies A₁ ∪ B₁ ≃ A₂ ∪ B₂.

This means that the disjoint union of A and B is indeed well-defined, up
to isomorphism: so long as 2 respective copies of A and B are made in a
way that their intersection is empty, the 2 respective unions of 1 copy
each will be isomorphic.

2.10)

Show that if A and B are finite sets, then |B^(A)| = |B|^(|A|).

The number of |B^(A)| functions in B^(A) = (A → B) can be counted in the
following way.

For each element a of A, of which there are |A|, we can pick any element
of B as the image; a total of |B| choices per choice of a. This means
|B| × ... × |B|, a total of |A| times. Hence, |B^(A)| = |B|^(|A|).

2.11)

In view of Exercise 2.10, it is not unreasonable to use 2^(A) to denote
the set of functions from an arbitrary set A to a set with 2 elements
(say 𝔹 = {0, 1}). Prove that there is a bijection between 2^(A) and the
power set 𝒫(A) of A.

Simply put, every subset A_(i) of A is built through a series of |A|
choices: for each element a in A, do we keep the element a in our subset
A_(i) (output 1) or do we remove it (output 0) ? It is then easy to see
that such a series of choices can easily be encoded as a unique function
in A → 𝔹. The totality of such series of choices thus corresponds both
to the space A → 𝔹, and to the powerset 𝒫(A), and there is a bijection
between the two.

Section 3)

3.1)

Let 𝒞 be a category. Consider a structure 𝒞^(op) with:

-   Obj(𝒞^(op)) ≔ Obj(𝒞);

-   for A, B objects of 𝒞^(op) (hence, objects of 𝒞),
    Hom_(𝒞^(op))(A, B) ≔ Hom_(𝒞)(B, A)

Show how to make this into a category.

3.1.a) Composition

First, to make things clearer and more rigorous, let us distinguish
composition in 𝒞 as ∘ and composition in 𝒞^(op) as ⋆. We define ⋆ as:
$$\begin{aligned}
    & \forall f \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B), \\
    & \forall g \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, B) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, C), \\
    & \exists h \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, C), \\
    & f \star g \coloneqq g \circ f = h
\end{aligned}$$

We will now show that 𝒞^(op) with ⋆ verifies the other axioms of a
category (namely identity and associativity of composition).

3.1.b) Identity

Since 𝒞 is a category, since 𝒞^(op) has the same objects, and since, by
definition, for all object A, we have
Hom_(𝒞^(op))(A, A) = Hom_(𝒞)(A, A), we can take every
id_(A) ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(A, A) as the same identity in 𝒞^(op). We can verify
that this is compatible with ⋆:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \forall A, B & \in Obj (\mathcal{C})        &=& \;  Obj (\mathcal{C}^{op})        , \\
    \exists id_A & \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, A) &=& \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (A, A) , \\
    \exists id_B & \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, B) &=& \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, B) , \\
    \forall f    & \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B) &=& \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) , \\
    f            & =   f    \circ id_A          &=& \;  id_A \star f                  , \\
    f            & =   id_B \circ    f          &=& \;  f    \star id_B                 \\
\end{aligned}$$

3.1.c) Associativity

Using associativity in 𝒞, we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \forall A, B, C, D & \in Obj (\mathcal{C})        &=& \;  Obj (\mathcal{C}^{op})        , \\
    \forall f          & \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B) &=& \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) , \\
    \forall g          & \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, C) &=& \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, B) , \\
    \forall h          & \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (C, D) &=& \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (D, C) , \\
\end{aligned}$$
$$\begin{aligned}
    h \star (g \star f) &=&  h \star (f  \circ g) \\
                        &=& (f \circ  g) \circ h  \\
                        &=&  f \circ (g  \circ h) \\
                        &=& (g \circ  h) \star f  \\
                        &=& (h \star  g) \star f  \\
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, ⋆ is associative.

We conclude that 𝒞^(op) is a category.

3.2)

If A is a finite set, how large is End_(Set)(A) ?

We know that, in Set, End_(Set)(A) = (A → A) = A^(A). From a previous
exercise, we know that |B^(A)| = |B|^(|A|), therefore
|End_(Set)(A)| = |A|^(|A|).

3.3)

Formulate precisely what it means to say that "1_(a) is an identity with
respect to composition" in Example 3.3, and prove this assertion.

Example 3.3 is that of a category over a set S with a (reflexive,
transitive) relation ∼, where the objects of the category are the
elements of S, and the homset between two elements a and b is the
singleton (a, b) if a ∼ b, and ∅ otherwise. Composition ∘ is given by
transitivity of ∼, where (b, c) ∘ (a, b) = (a, c). Reflexivity gives the
identities (id_(a) = (a, a) for any element a).

In this context, to say that "1_(a) is an identity with respect to
composition" means that we can cancel out an element of the form (a, a)
from a composition.

Formally, we have:

∀a, b ∈ S, (b, b) ∘ (a, b) = (a, b) = (a, b) ∘ (a, a)

proving that (b, b) is indeed a post-identity, and (a, a) a
pre-identity, in this context.

3.4)

Can we define a category in the style of Example 3.3, using the relation
< on the set ℤ ?

(Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)

Naively, saying like in example 3.3 "there is a singleton homset
Hom(a, b) each time we have a < b", we cannot define such a category,
since < is not reflexive, and we would thus lack identity morphisms.

However, in a roundabout way, we can define a category over the negation
of <: "there is a singleton homset Hom(a, b) each time we DO NOT have
a < b". Namely this corresponds to the relation ≥, which is, itself,
reflexive, transitive (and antisymmetric), and is a valid instance of
the kind of category presented in example 3.3.

In fact, the pair (ℤ,  ≥ ) is an instance of what is called a "totally
ordered set", which is a more restrictive kind of "partially ordered
set" (also called "poset" for short). Consequently, this kind of
category is called a "poset category".

3.5)

Explain in what sense Example 3.4 is an instance of the categories
considered in Example 3.3.

(Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)

Example 3.4 describes a category Ŝ where the objects are the subsets of
a set S (equivalently: elements of the powerset 𝒫(S) of S), and
morphisms between two subsets A and B of S are singleton (or empty)
homsets based on whether the inclusion is true (or false).

Inclusion of sets, ⊂, is also an order relation, this time between the
elements of a set of sets (here, 𝒫(S)). This means inclusion is
reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. This makes Ŝ a poset category,
and thus another instance of example 3.3.

3.6)

Define a category V by taking Obj(V) = ℕ, and
Hom_(V)(n, m) = Mat_(ℝ)(m, n), the set of m × n matrices with real
entries, for all n, m ∈ ℕ. (I will leave the reader the task to make
sense of a matrix with 0 rows or columns.) Use product of matrices to
define composition. Does this category ’feel’ familiar ?

The formulation of the exercise is strange. It says to use the product
of matrices to define composition, and to have homsets be sets of
matrices, but objects of the category are supposed to be integers. I
don’t know of any matrix with real entries that maps an integer to an
integer in this way.

We thus infer that the meaning of the exercise can be one of two things.

Either we suppose the set of objects could rather be understood as
"something isomorphic to ℕ", ie, the collection of real vector spaces
with finite bases (ie, ∀n ∈ ℕ, ℝ^(n)). In which case, this is just the
category of real vector spaces with finite basis (and linear maps as
morphisms), which is a subcategory of the category real vector spaces
(commonly called Vect_(ℝ)). In this context, any morphism starting from
0 ≃ ℝ⁰ = {0} is just the injection of the origin into the codomain; and
any morphism ending at 0 is the mapping of all elements to the origin.

Otherwise, we understand this as "yes, the objects of the category are
integers: this means you should ignore the actual content of the
matrices, and instead consider only their effect on the dimensionality
of domains and codomains". In this case, this category is a complete
directed graph over ℕ where each edge corresponds to the change in
dimension (from domain to codomain) caused by a given linear map.

3.7)

Define carefully objects and morphisms in Example 3.7, and draw the
diagram corresponding to composition.

Example 3.7 (on coslice categories) refers to example 3.5 (on slice
categories). Let’s go over slice categories (since example 3.5 asks the
reader to "check all [their various properties]").

3.7.1) Slice categories

Slice categories are categories made by singling out an object (say A)
in some parent (larger) category (say 𝒞), and studying all morphisms
into that object. These morphisms become the objects of a new category
(ie, for any Z of 𝒞, f ∈ (Z → A) is an object of the slice category,
called 𝒞_(A) in this context). In the slice category, morphisms are
defined as those morphism in 𝒞 that preserve composition between 2
morphisms into A.

Note that there exist pairs of morphisms f₁ ∈ (Z₁ → A) and f₂ ∈ (Z₂ → A)
between which there is no morphism that exists in the slice category.
One such example we can make is in (Vect_(ℝ))_(ℝ²) (see notes "On the
morphisms of slice and coslice categories" for more details).

3.7.1.a) Identity

A generic identity morphism is expressed diagrammatically in 𝒞_(A) as:

We can see that since f = f ∘ id_(Z) in 𝒞, this is compatible with the
definition of a (pre-/right-)unit morphism in 𝒞_(A). Also, since the
only maps post-f are maps from A → A, we have id_(A) as the
(post-/left-)unit for every morphism f (ie, f = id_(A) ∘ f.

3.7.1.b) Composition

Taking 3 objects of the slice category (f₁ ∈ (Z₁ → A), f₂ ∈ (Z₂ → A) and
f₃ ∈ (Z₃ → A)), and two morphisms (σ_(A) mapping f₁ to f₂ via a
𝒞-morphism σ ∈ (Z₁ → Z₂), and τ_(A) mapping f₂ to f₃ via a 𝒞-morphism
τ ∈ (Z₂ → Z₃)), we have that f₁ = f₂ ∘ σ and f₂ = f₃ ∘ τ. This is
expressed as the following commutative diagram.

Composition of morphisms is then defined as τ_(A)∘_(A)σ_(A) as a mapping
from f₁ to f₃, such that f₁ = f₃ ∘ (τ ∘ σ). This can be understood
through the following commutative diagram:

Which commutes, because we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
    f_1 &=&  f_2              \circ \sigma  \\
        &=& (f_3 \circ  \tau) \circ \sigma  \\
        &=&  f_3 \circ (\tau  \circ \sigma)
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, we have a working composition of morphisms.

3.7.1.c) Associativity

We take 4 objects of the slice category (f₁ ∈ (Z₁ → A), f₂ ∈ (Z₂ → A),
f₃ ∈ (Z₃ → A) and f₄ ∈ (Z₄ → A)), and three morphisms (σ_(A) mapping f₁
to f₂, τ_(A) mapping f₂ to f₃, and υ_(A) mapping f₃ to f₄). Using
composition defined as above, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
f_1 &=& f_4 \circ ( \upsilon \circ (\tau  \circ \sigma)) \\
    &=& f_4 \circ ((\upsilon \circ  \tau) \circ \sigma ) \\
\Rightarrow && \\
& &  \upsilon_A \circ (\tau_A  \circ \sigma_A) \\
&=& (\upsilon_A \circ  \tau_A) \circ \sigma_A
\end{aligned}$$

Through associativity in 𝒞.

3.7.2) Coslice categories

A coslice category 𝒞^(A) is similar, except it takes the morphisms
coming from a chosen object A, rather than those going to this object A.
Below is a commutative diagram in the style of the one of the textbook
for slice categories.

We can similarly show that this also defines a category.

3.7.2.a) Identity

A generic identity morphism is expressed diagrammatically in 𝒞^(A) as:

We can see that since f = id_(Z) ∘ f in 𝒞, this is compatible with the
definition of a (post-/left-)unit morphism in 𝒞^(A). Also, since the
only maps pre-f are maps from A → A, we have id_(A) as the
(pre-/right-)unit for every morphism f (ie, f = f ∘ id_(A).

3.7.2.b) Composition

Taking 3 objects of the slice category (f₁ ∈ (A → Z₁), f₂ ∈ (A → Z₂) and
f₃ ∈ (A → Z₃)), and two morphisms (σ^(A) mapping f₁ to f₂ via a
𝒞-morphism σ ∈ (Z₁ → Z₂), and τ^(A) mapping f₂ to f₃ via a 𝒞-morphism
τ ∈ (Z₂ → Z₃)), we have that f₁ = σ ∘ f₂ and f₂ = τ ∘ f₃. This is
expressed as the following commutative diagram.

Composition of morphisms is then defined as τ^(A)∘^(A)σ^(A) as a mapping
from f₁ to f₃, such that f₃ = (τ ∘ σ) ∘ f₁. This can be understood
through the following commutative diagram:

Which commutes, because we have:

$$\begin{aligned}
    f_3 &=&  \tau \circ                f_2  \\
        &=&  \tau \circ (\sigma  \circ f_1) \\
        &=& (\tau \circ  \sigma) \circ f_1
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, we have a working composition of morphisms.

3.7.2.c) Associativity

We take 4 objects of the slice category (f₁ ∈ (A → Z₁), f₂ ∈ (A → Z₂),
f₃ ∈ (A → Z₃) and f₄ ∈ (A → Z₄)), and three morphisms (σ^(A) mapping f₁
to f₂, τ^(A) mapping f₂ to f₃, and υ^(A) mapping f₃ to f₄). Using
composition defined as above, we have

$$\begin{aligned}
f_4 &=& ( \upsilon \circ (\tau  \circ \sigma)) \circ f_1 \\
    &=& ((\upsilon \circ  \tau) \circ \sigma ) \circ f_1 \\
\Rightarrow && \\
    & &  \upsilon^A \circ (\tau^A  \circ \sigma^A) \\
    &=& (\upsilon^A \circ  \tau^A) \circ \sigma^A
\end{aligned}$$

Through associativity in 𝒞.

3.8)

A subcategory 𝒞′ of a category 𝒞 consists of a collection of objects of
𝒞, with morphisms Hom_(𝒞′)(A, B) ⊆ Hom_(𝒞)(A, B) for all objects A, B in
Obj(𝒞′), such that identities and compositions in 𝒞 make 𝒞′ into a
category. A subcategory 𝒞′ is full if Hom_(𝒞′)(A, B) = Hom_(𝒞)(A, B) for
all A, B in Obj(𝒞′). Construct a category of infinite sets and explain
how it may be viewed as a full subcategory of Set.

To put it less technically, a "subcategory" 𝒞′ is just "picking only
certain items of a base category 𝒞, and making sure that things stay
closed uneder morphism composition". It is "full" if all morphisms
between the objects that remain are also conserved.

We can construct a category InfSet of infinite sets by taking all the
objects A of Set such that ∄n ∈ ℕ, |A| = n, and only homsets between
these objects. This is clearly a subcategory of Set, since it inherits
all identity morphisms, composition works the same, and so does
associativity; also, restricting the choice of homsets makes it so that
the category is closed (you can’t reach a finite set via a homset that
went from an infinite to a finite set).

For this category to not be full, there would need to be some homset
that loses a morphism, or fully disappears, in the ordeal. However,
there is no restriction as to the kind of morphism that is conserved, so
any homset that is kept is identical to its original version. Finally,
homsets between infinite sets are also infinite sets, so they don’t
disappear in this operation.

Consequently InfSet defined as such is a full subcategory of Set.

3.9)

An alternative to the notion of multiset introduced in §2.2 is obtained
by considering sets endowed with equivalence relations; equivalent
elements are taken to be multiple instances of elements ’of the same
kind’. Define a notion of morphism between such enhanced sets, obtaining
a category MSet containing (a ’copy’ of) Set as a full subcategory.
(There may be more than one reasonable way to do this! This is
intentionally an open-ended exercise.) Which objects in MSet determine
ordinary multisets as defined in §2.2, and how? Spell out what a
morphism of multisets would be from this point of view. (There are
several natural notions of morphisms of multisets. Try to define
morphisms in MSet so that the notion you obtain for ordinary multisets
captures your intuitive understanding of these objects.) [§2.2, §3.2,
4.5]

Let us recall how multisets were defined in §2.2. Since duplicate
elements do not exist in sets, multisets were instead defined as
functions from a set S to ℕ*, the set of (nonzero) positive integers.
This allows each element in S to have a "count", thereby encoding the
intuitive notion of multiset. A similar, and equivalent (isomorphic),
way of defining it is via pairs (s, n) ∈ S × ℕ*, which is simpler to
think about. We’ll call this category CMSet, for "count multiset" (TODO:
probably has a conventional and better name, but I don’t know it). As
for morphisms in CMSet, we can consider that for any multisets
A = S_(A) × ℕ* and B = S_(B) × ℕ*, the homset from A to B is simply the
set functions from S_(A) × ℕ* to S_(B) × ℕ* as usual.

We first notice that if we restrict CMSet to only the objects for which
all elements have a count of 1, and where morphisms only ever output to
{1} in the second coordinate (a subcategory we can call C1MSet, for
example), we get a "copy" of Set: C1MSet and Set are isomorphic in Cat.
This is a full subcategory because there are no morphisms that map
counts to anything else than {1} if we restrict our objects to this
form; so all morphisms between the kept objects are also kept.

Now let us do a similar construction, but based on equivalence classes
instead. We know that each equivalence class over a set corresponds
uniquely to a partition of that set. By considering only these
partitions (these "sets of sets") as objects, we can build a category
EMSet (for "equivalence multiset"). The "count" corresponds simply to
the cardinal of a top-level element in the partition. For example, the
top-level elements of M = {S₁, S₂, S₃} = {{a}, {b, c}, {d, e, f}} would
be understood to have counts |S₁| = 1, |S₂| = 2 and |S₃| = 3
respectively.

As for morphisms in EMSet, they simply map each top-level element of the
domain multiset (a distinct subset of the original set) to some other
top-level elements in the codomain multiset. This has precisely the same
effect as mapping pairs of "value and count" as seen in the previous
CMSet construction.

In this example, any set itself, when "injected" (by a functor) into
EMSet would just nest all of its elements into singletons. I.e.,
S = {a, b, c} in Set would become S = {{a}, {b}, {c}} in EMSet. This
also shows how restricting EMSet to "only objects that are a set of
(toplevel) singletons" makes EMSet have a "copy" of Set as a full
subcategory (for similar arguments as above).

Yet another example could be something akin to polynomials with integer
coefficients on freeform indeterminates of degree 1 (which would be our
set elements); raising the operators one rank, a product of freeform
variables with integer powers (multiplicities), etc.

3.10)

Since the objects of a category 𝒞 are not (necessarily) sets, it is not
clear how to make sense of a notion of ’subobject’ in general. In some
situations it does make sense to talk about subobjects, and the
subobjects of any given object A in 𝒞 are in one-to-one correspondence
with the morphisms A → Ω for a fixed, special object Ω of 𝒞, called a
subobject classifier. Show that Set has a subobject classifier.

We define the set 𝔹 = {0, 1}, aka the binary alphabet or booleans, as
the subobject classifier of Set. For any subset A of B, there is a
unique map f : B → 𝔹, such that ∀b ∈ B, f(b) = 1 ⇔ b ∈ A (otherwise
f(b) = 0, of course, as the equivalence and lack of alternatives to 0 as
an output imply). The map f always fully describes A from its
relationship with B.

3.11)

Draw the relevant diagrams and define composition and identities for the
category 𝒞^(A, B) mentioned in Example 3.9. Do the same for the category
𝒞^(α, β) mentioned in Example 3.10. [§5.5, 5.12]

For lack of a better term, we will refer to the categories of the form
𝒞_(A, B) represented by Example 3.9 as "bi-slice categories". The first
part of the exercise is thus asking us to define and explain what
"bi-coslice categories" (of the form 𝒞^(A, B)) are.

Similarly, we will refer to the categories of the form 𝒞_(α, β)
represented by Example 3.10 as "fibered bi-slice categories". The second
part of the exercise is thus asking us to define and explain what
"fibered bi-coslice categories" (of the form 𝒞^(α, β)) are.

We will, of course, attempt to make more formal and pedagogical all
definitions broached in the textbook’s examples as well.

3.11.1) Bi-slice categories

3.11.1.a) Objects and morphisms

To make a bi-slice category 𝒞_(A, B), we pick 2 objects A and B of a
base category 𝒞, and consider for all other objects Z of 𝒞, all pairs of
morphisms (f, g) ∈ (Z → A) × (Z → B). These pairs of morphisms are the
objects of the bi-slice category 𝒞_(A, B). Morphisms σ_(A, B) are
defined from an object p₁ = (f₁, g₁) ∈ (Z₁ → A) × (Z₁ → B) to an object
p₂ = (f₂, g₂) ∈ (Z₂ → A) × (Z₂ → B) so that we have both f₁ = f₂ ∘ σ and
g₁ = g₂ ∘ σ, for some σ ∈ (Z₁ → Z₂).

A generic object in 𝒞_(A, B) is of the form:

3.11.1.b) Morphisms

Morphisms are defined between objects as

such that the following diagram commutes

3.11.1.c) Identity

It is clear that identity morphisms exist for all objects, simply by
taking Z = Z₁ = Z₂, f₁ = f₂, g₁ = g₂ and σ = id_(Z), in the diagram
above.

3.11.1.d) Composition

Let be 3 objects of 𝒞_(A, B), which we will name p₁, p₂ and p₃ (and
define with the respective (Z_(n), f_(n), g_(n)) triplet for p_(n)).

Composition τ_(A, B) ∘ σ_(A, B) = p₁ ↦ p₃ of two morphisms
σ_(A, B) = p₁ ↦ p₂ and τ_(A, B) = p₂ ↦ p₃ is defined so that the
following diagram commutes.

3.11.1.e) Associativity

Associativity follows from associativity of morphisms in 𝒞, similarly to
what was done for slice categories in exercise 3.7 .

3.11.2) Bi-coslice categories

3.11.2.a) Objects and morphisms

To make a bi-coslice category 𝒞^(A, B), we similarly pick 2 objects A
and B of our base category 𝒞, but instead consider, for all other
objects Z of 𝒞, all pairs of morphisms (f, g) ∈ (A → Z) × (B → Z).

A generic object in 𝒞^(A, B) is of the form:

3.11.2.b) Morphisms

Morphisms are defined between objects as

such that the following diagram commutes

3.11.2.c) Identity

It is clear that identity morphisms exist for all objects, simply by
taking Z = Z₁ = Z₂, f₁ = f₂, g₁ = g₂ and σ = id_(Z), in the diagram
above.

3.11.2.d) Composition

Let be 3 objects of 𝒞^(A, B), which we will name p₁, p₂ and p₃ (and
define with the respective (Z_(n), f_(n), g_(n)) triplet for p_(n)).

Composition τ^(A, B) ∘ σ^(A, B) = p₁ ↦ p₃ of two morphisms
σ^(A, B) = p₁ ↦ p₂ and τ^(A, B) = p₂ ↦ p₃ is defined so that the
following diagram commutes.

3.11.2.e) Associativity

Associativity follows from associativity of morphisms in 𝒞, similarly to
what was done for slice categories in exercise 3.7 .

3.11.3) Fibered bi-slice categories

3.11.3.a) Objects

To build a fibered bi-slice category 𝒞_(α, β), one takes a base category
𝒞, as well as a fixed pair of morphisms α : A → C and β : B → C in 𝒞,
that point to a common object C of 𝒞. Our basic "fixed construct" from 𝒞
looks like so:

The role of the category 𝒞_(α, β) is now to study the morphisms into
this construct. A generic object from this new category looks like so:

such that the diagram commutes. This means that valid object in 𝒞_(α, β)
are triplets (Z, f, g), with f : Z → A and g : Z → B, such that
α ∘ f = β ∘ g. In a caricatural way, this boils down to studying "the
comparison of the different paths one can use to reach C, knowing that
the last steps are on one hand, α, and on the other, β".

3.11.3.b) Morphisms

Morphisms are defined between objects as:

such that the following diagram commutes

3.11.3.c) Identity

Once again, it is clear that identity morphisms exist for all objects,
simply by taking Z = Z₁ = Z₂, f₁ = f₂, g₁ = g₂ and σ = id_(Z), in the
diagram above.

3.11.3.d) Composition

Let be 3 objects of 𝒞_(α, β), which we will name p₁, p₂ and p₃ (and
define with the respective (Z_(n), f_(n), g_(n)) triplet for p_(n)).

Composition τ_(α, β) ∘ σ_(α, β) = p₁ ↦ p₃ of two morphisms
σ_(α, β) = p₁ ↦ p₂ and τ_(α, β) = p₂ ↦ p₃ is defined so that the
following diagram commutes.

3.11.3.e) Associativity

Associativity follows from associativity of morphisms in 𝒞, similarly to
what was done for slice categories in exercise 3.7 .

3.11.4) Fibered bi-coslice categories

3.11.4.a) Objects

To build a fibered bi-coslice category 𝒞^(α, β), one takes a base
category 𝒞, as well as a fixed pair of morphisms α : C → A and β : C → B
in 𝒞, that originate from a common object C of 𝒞. Our basic "fixed
construct" from 𝒞 looks like so:

The role of the category 𝒞^(α, β) is now to study the morphisms from
this construct. A generic object from this new category looks like so:

such that the diagram commutes. This means that valid object in 𝒞^(α, β)
are triplets (Z, f, g), with f : A → Z and g : B → Z, such that
f ∘ α = g ∘ β. In a caricatural way, this boils down to studying "the
comparison of the different paths one can build by starting from C,
knowing that the choice of first step is on one hand, α, and on the
other, β".

3.11.4.b) Morphisms

Morphisms are defined between objects as:

such that the following diagram commutes

3.11.4.c) Identity

Once again, it is clear that identity morphisms exist for all objects,
simply by taking Z = Z₁ = Z₂, f₁ = f₂, g₁ = g₂ and σ = id_(Z), in the
diagram above.

3.11.4.d) Composition

Let be 3 objects of 𝒞^(α, β), which we will name p₁, p₂ and p₃ (and
define with the respective (Z_(n), f_(n), g_(n)) triplet for p_(n)).

Composition τ^(α, β) ∘ σ^(α, β) = p₁ ↦ p₃ of two morphisms
σ^(α, β) = p₁ ↦ p₂ and τ^(α, β) = p₂ ↦ p₃ is defined so that the
following diagram commutes.

3.11.4.e) Associativity

Associativity follows from associativity of morphisms in 𝒞, similarly to
what was done for slice categories in exercise 3.7 .

Section 4)

4.1)

Composition is defined for two morphisms. If more than 2 morphisms are
given, one may compose them in several ways, so that every step only
consists in composing 2 morphisms. Prove that for any such valid
sequence of morphisms, the order of parentheses doesn’t matter.

This boils down to showing that associativity is a global property, that
doesn’t just make parentheses meaningless when there are 3 elements and
2 operators between them, but in general n elements with (n − 1)
operators between them.

Note: A useful way of visualizing this is representing the order of
operations as a binary tree, and noticing that applying associativity
(forwards or backwards) is just a tree rotation (resp. right or left) at
a given node. Then it is easy to show that one can always obtain a "left
comb binary tree". Since every choice of parentheses is equal to this
left comb choice, and equality is transitive, every choice of
parentheses is equal to every other choice.

To be more rigorous, we will proceed by induction.

Hypothesis: P(n) = "for a given n, for f_(n)f_(n − 1) ⋅ f₁ any valid,
composable, ordered sequence of morphisms in our base category 𝒞, any
choice H of parentheses to compose elements of this sequence 2-by-2,
giving a formula s_(H), will lead to the same result, which can be seen
by always having s_(H) = ( ⋅ (f_(n)f_(n − 1)) ⋅ )f₁".

Initialization: We initialize at n = 3; the validity is immediate as it
is precisely the definition of associativity.

Heredity: We suppose the hypothesis P(n) true for a given n ≥ 3; let us
show that this implies that the hypothesis is true for P(n + 1).

What this means is that, no matter the composable ordered sequence
f_(n)f_(n − 1) ⋅ f₁ of n functions, for a fixed n, the order of
parentheses does not matter. Note that though n is chosen and fixed; the
statement is true for EVERY (ordered, composable) sequence of functions.
We add a new function g to this sequence. By a simple renaming of the
functions, we deduce that it doesn’t matter where we insert g, so we’ll
insert it at the very right to simplify our argument, giving us the
sequence f_(n)f_(n − 1) ⋅ f₁g.

Here, there are 3 cases. Either:

-   g is part of the last composition (i.e., it’s not in a semantically
    necessary parenthethical grouping; it can be made external to all
    parentheses),

-   g is part of the first composition (i.e., the first operation is
    (f₁g))

-   it isn’t either (it’s inside some non-removable parentheses, and
    needs to be composed earlier on, but not as the first operation).

If g is part of the last composition, then by applying the hypothesis
P(n) to the terms f_(n)f_(n − 1) ⋅ f₁, we immediately find that our new
sequence can be made equal to (( ⋅ (f_(n)f_(n − 1)) ⋅ )f₁)g, which is
precisely what we wanted for P(n + 1).

If g is part of the first composition, we isolate it so that it isn’t
anymore. To do so, we apply "backwards" associativity on the grouping of
terms F_(k)(f₁g) in order to obtain (F_(k)f₁)g, where F_(k) is the
appropriate choice of (f_(k) ⋅ f₂) such that associativity can be
applied (with 2 ≤ k ≤ n). This makes it so that our problem is identical
to our final case, solved just below.

If g is part of neither the first nor last composition, then we consider
the innermost composition (f_(k)f_(k − 1)) to be a single element h. We
now have a sequence of only n terms. We apply our hypothesis P(n). This
makes g the outermost right term, part of the last composition.
Unravelling h back into two members, we see that we are back at our
initial case, with an arbitrary order of parentheses for the
f_(n)f_(n − 1) ⋅ f₁ terms, and g outermost. We already saw that this
implied P(n + 1).

Conclusion: since we have initialization and heredity of our hypothesis
in all cases, we can conclude by induction that it is true for all
n ≥ 3.

4.2)

In Example 3.3 we have seen how to construct a category from a set
endowed with a relation, provided the latter is reflexive and
transitive. For what types of relations is the corresponding category a
groupoid (cf. Example 4.6) ?

We remind example 4.6 : a groupoid is a category in which every morphism
is an isomorphism. This means that every morphism needs to be 2-way
invertible.

In this context, this means that for every morphism a ∼ b, there should
be a corresponding inverse morphism b ∼ a. This property is precisely
the symmetry of a relation.

This means that all sets with an equivalence relation can be
reconstructed into a groupoid.

4.3)

Let A, B be objects of a category 𝒞, and f ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(A, B) a morphism.
Prove that if f has a pre-inverse, then f is an epimorphism. Show that
the converse does not hold, by giving an explicit example of a category
and an epimorphism without a pre-inverse.

4.3.a)

f has a pre-inverse ⇒ f is an epimorphism

Let 𝒞 be a category. Let f ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(A, B), having some pre-inverse
which we’ll call g ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(B, A):

Let Z be an arbitrary object of 𝒞, and
$\beta', \beta" \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, Z)$:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \beta' \circ f = \beta'' \circ f
        & \Rightarrow (\beta' \circ  f) \circ g  = (\beta'' \circ  f) \circ g  \\
        & =            \beta' \circ (f  \circ g) =  \beta'' \circ (f  \circ g) \\
        & =            \beta' \circ id_B         =  \beta'' \circ id_B \\
        & =            \beta'                    =  \beta''
\end{aligned}$$

This means that f is an epimorphism.

4.3.b)

f is an epimorphism $\;\not\!\!\!\Rightarrow$ f has a pre-inverse

As was mentioned in the text, "order" categories (poset categories)
where there’s only at most one morphism between any two objects makes it
so that every morphism is trivially an epimorphism (i.e., since there is
at most one morphism "≤" between any two elements, so you always have
$\beta' = \beta" = \leq$, and since $\beta' = \beta"$ is always true,
anything implication with it as a necessary condition is also true, and
therefore every morphism is true). However, only identities have any
kind of inverse (since they are isomorphisms, they are their own
inverse); other combinations of elements go one-way, because of
antisymmetry.

See also here and here.

4.4)

Prove that the composition of two monomorphisms is a monomorphism.
Deduce that one can define a subcategory 𝒞_(mono) of a category 𝒞 by
taking the same objects as in 𝒞, and defining Hom_(𝒞_(mono))(A, B) to be
the subset of Hom_(𝒞)(A, B) consisting of monomorphisms, for all objects
A, B. (Cf. Exercise 3.8; of course, in general 𝒞_(mono) is not full in
𝒞.) Do the same for epimorphisms. Can you define a subcategory
𝒞_(nonmono) of 𝒞 by restricting to morphisms that are not monomorphisms?

4.4.a)

Mono

Let be f ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(A, B) and g ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(B, C) be monomorphisms. Let us
show that g ∘ f is also a monomorphism.

Let Z be an arbitrary object of 𝒞, and
$\alpha', \alpha" \in Hom_{\mathcal{A}} (Z, A)$:

$$\begin{aligned}
    (g \circ f) \circ \alpha' = (g \circ f) \circ \alpha''
        & = g \circ (f \circ \alpha') = g \circ (f \circ \alpha'') \\
        & \Rightarrow f \circ \alpha' = f \circ \alpha'' \text{ because $g$ is mono} \\
        & \Rightarrow         \alpha' =         \alpha'' \text{ because $f$ is mono}
\end{aligned}$$

This means that the composition of 2 monomorphisms is always an
monomorphism. We can thus make a subcategory. Taking all objects,
properties, and homsets of 𝒞, but restricting the homsets only to the
monomorphisms, we know that this makes a new category 𝒞_(mono) since it
is closed under composition, has identities (which are iso, and a
fortiori mono) and associativity.

4.4.b)

Epi

Let be f ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(A, B) and g ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(B, C) be epimorphisms. Let us
show that g ∘ f is also a epimorphism.

Let Z be an arbitrary object of 𝒞, and
$\beta', \beta" \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (C, Z)$:

$$\begin{aligned}
    \beta' \circ (g \circ f) = \beta'' \circ (g \circ f)
        & = (\beta' \circ g) \circ f = (\beta'' \circ g) \circ f \\
        & \Rightarrow \beta' \circ g =  \beta'' \circ g \text{ because $f$ is epi} \\
        & \Rightarrow \beta'         =  \beta''         \text{ because $g$ is epi}
\end{aligned}$$

This means that the composition of 2 epimorphisms is always an
epimorphism. We can thus make a subcategory. Taking all objects,
properties, and homsets of 𝒞, but restricting the homsets only to the
epimorphisms, we know that this makes a new category 𝒞_(epi) since it is
closed under composition, has identities (which are iso, and a fortiori
epi) and associativity.

4.4.c)

Nonmono and nonepi

We could consider the fact that (TODO prove lol) we can’t obtain a
monomorphism from the composition of two non-monomorphisms (you need at
least one monomorphism in the mix). However, the real problem is
identities. Identities are iso, and thus mono. You can’t make a category
without identities, so there is no such 𝒞_(nonmono). the same reasoning
applies to 𝒞_(nonepi).

4.5)

Give a concrete description of monomorphisms and epimorphisms in the
category MSet you constructed in Exercise 3.9. (Your answer will depend
on the notion of morphism you defined in that exercise!)

We’ll use our CMSet construction, where elements of multisets consisted
of a pair of the set-element and its count in the multiset.

We recall that in the way we formulated this, morphisms were just simple
set functions on "(element, count)" pairs (i.e., returning any other
"(element, count)" pair of the codomain). Let be a morphism of multisets
f ∈ (A → B). Labelling the elements of the domain A as a_(i) and of the
codomain B as b_(j) with i ∈ I, j ∈ J, and I, J any two indexing sets
such that card(A) = card(I) and card(B) = card(J), we can see that A and
B now just look like "normal" sets.

We now simply recycle the notion of injections and surjections. These
form our monomorphisms and epimorphisms respectively.

Section 5)

5.1)

Prove that a final object in a category 𝒞 is initial in the opposite
category 𝒞^(op)

Let 𝒞 be a category. Let 𝒞^(op) be the dual category on 𝒞. Let F be a
final object in 𝒞. This means that for every object Z in 𝒞, there is a
single morphism from Z to F. We will call this morphism f_(Z)
(respectively).

We remind how we defined composition in 𝒞^(op) as ⋆, respecting:
$$\begin{aligned}
    & \forall f \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B), \\
    & \forall g \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, B) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, C), \\
    & \exists h \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, C), \\
    & f \star g \coloneqq g \circ f = h
\end{aligned}$$

In this case, we see that
∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞^(op)) = Obj(𝒞), f_(Z) ∈ Hom_(𝒞^(op))(F, Z) = Hom_(𝒞)(Z, F).
This implies that the homset Hom_(𝒞^(op))(F, Z) contains a single
morphism, f_(Z). This means that F is initial in 𝒞^(op).

5.2)

Prove that ∅ is the unique initial object in Set.

First we will prove that it is initial, then that it is unique.

Initiality: we take an arbitrary set Z in Set. We wish to study
$Hom_{\text{\textbf{Set}}}(\emptyset, Z) = Z^\emptyset$. We recall that
functions (in category theory) are defined as "applications" /
"mappings" are in traditional set theory (i.e., as a relation between
sets where every antecedent in the domain has a singleton image in the
codomain; the key point being that "no input has no result when passed
through the function"). Let I be an initial element in Set. We write
|I| = n and |Z| = m. We know that |Z^(I)| = |Z|^(|I|) = m^(n). For I to
be initial, this is true if and only if m^(n) = 1 for all m, and so if
and only if n = 0. We recall that the empty set is the only set with
|∅| = 0, therefore I = ∅.

Now this is already enough to prove unicity, but let us spell it out for
pedagogy’s sake.

Unicity: We recall that two objects of Set are isomorphic if, and only
if, there exists a bijection between them. This is equivalent to saying
that two sets have the same cardinal. We once again recall that the
empty set is the only set with |∅| = 0; there are no bijections relating
to the empty set, other than its identity, the unique morphism in
$Hom_{\text{\textbf{Set}}}(\emptyset, \emptyset)$ . Using proposition
5.4 (that terminal objects are unique up-to-isomorphism), we finally
deduce that ∅ is the unique initial object in Set.

NB: the unique function in Z^(∅) is always the empty function.

5.3)

Prove that final objects are unique up to isomorphism.

Let us suppose we have a category 𝒞 with two final objects, F₁ and F₂.

For every object A of 𝒞 there is at least one element in Hom_(𝒞)(A, A),
namely the identity 1_(A). If F is final, then there is a unique
morphism F → F, which therefore must be the identity 1_(F).

We assumed that F₁ and F₂ are both final in 𝒞. Since F₁ is final, there
is a unique morphism f : F₂ → F₁ in 𝒞. Since F₂ is final, there is a
unique morphism g : F₁ → F₂ in 𝒞. Consider fg : F₁ → F₁ ; as observed,
necessarily the composite fg = 1_(F₁) since F₁ is final. By the same
token gf = 1_(F₂). Thus f and g are inverses of each other, proving f is
an isomorphism. Since there exists an isomorphism between F₁ and F₂,
F₁ ≃ F₂.

5.4)

What are initial and final objects in the category of "pointed sets"
(Example 3.8)? Are they unique?

We recall that a pointed set is just a regular set with a special,
identified point, and that the category of pointed sets Set* is built
upon the same objects as Set, but where each object A in Set is
multiplied into |A| copies of itself in Set* (one for each choice of
special point; this implies that the empty set is not a part of Set*,
since it has no point). Morphisms in Set* are set functions, but with
the restriction of mapping the special point in the domain to the
special point in the codomain.

Given this information, we will prove that the initial and final objects
in Set* are the singleton sets.

Let (O, o) be a singleton set in Set*. Let o be the single element of O;
it is necessarily also the special point, as there is no other choice.
For any codomain (Z, z₀) in Set*, the condition that "special points map
to special points" restricts our choice of function to the unique
function (o, z₀), thus, O is initial. If O had more than one element,
there would exist some Z (non-singletons) for which the other element
would allow another degree of freedom (and thus O would not be initial).

Similarly, now studying Z as a domain and O as a codomain, we see that
that only function from Z to O is (like in Set) the function which maps
everything (including Z’s special point) to o. Thus, O is final. If O
had more than one element, there would similarly be many choices for any
Z of cardinal  ≥ 2, so long as the special point maps to the special
point.

Every singleton pointed set is both initial and final in Set* and is
thus a zero object. These are also the only such pointed sets.

5.5)

What are the final objects in the category considered in §5.3?

The category considered in paragraph 5.3 is the coslice category over
some set A, written 𝒞_(A). However, what is presented in this paragraph
is some extra structure that arises when considering the statement "The
quotient A/∼ is universal with respect to the property of mapping A to a
set in such a way that equivalent elements have the same image". We thus
give some equivalence relation ∼ on A and study the quotient set A/∼ in
the general coslice category; to do this, we consider the subcategory 𝒬
of 𝒞_(A) where only φ such that "equivalence is preserved" (i.e., such
that ∀a′, a″ ∈ A, a′ ∼ a″ ⇒ φ(a′) = φ(a″)).

With:

-   s the canonical surjection of A onto its quotient A/∼,

-   φ₁ (resp. φ₂) being some arbitrary function from A to some arbitrary
    Z₁ (resp. Z₂),

-   σ any function (if it exists) such that σφ₁ = φ₂

-   f₁ (resp. f₂) is the (unique!) function such that sf₁ = φ₁ (resp.
    sf₂ = φ₂)

The following diagram commutes, and summarizes the situation.

Objects in this category 𝒞_(A) (and a fortiori 𝒬) are denoted as (φ, Z)
and are obtained from what used to be morphisms (regular functions) in
Set. Morphisms are mappings σ_(𝒬) : (φ₁, Z₁) → (φ₂, Z₂) such that one
exists if and only if ∃σ ∈ (Z₁ → Z₂), σφ₁ = φ₂, and
∀a′, a″ ∈ A, a′ ∼ a″ ⇒ φ(a′) = φ(a″).

Since the textbook also asks whether such a category has initial
objects, we will first also answer this and consider all terminal
objects.

The initial object of a general coslice category is (id_(A), A). This is
easily verified by doing φ₁ = id_(A), necessarily
σφ₁ = σid_(A) = σ = φ₂, in 𝒞. This implies that, for the domain
(id_(A), A) in 𝒞_(A) and any codomain (ϕ₂, Z₂), there always exists a
unique morphism σ_(A) ∈ Hom_(C_(A))((id_(A), A), (ϕ₂, Z₂)) in 𝒞_(A),
corresponding to the (existing and unique) σ = ϕ₂ in 𝒞. We also see that
this object satisfies the "equivalence preservation" condition, hence it
exists in 𝒬, and is also the initial object in 𝒬.

The below are this description first in 𝒞, followed by the description
in 𝒞_(A).

Now in 𝒞_(A).

A general coslice category has a final object (t, F) (or many final
objects (t_(i), F_(i))) iff 𝒞 has a final object F (or many final
objects F_(i)). In that case, any final object (t, F) in 𝒞_(A)
corresponds to the unique morphism from A to F (for any final F) in 𝒞.
Let us verify this.

Let F be final in 𝒞, and t be the unique morphism t ∈ Hom_(𝒞)(A, F). Let
(φ, Z) be an arbitrary object of 𝒞_(A). Let be σ such that σφ = t. We
consider the following diagram:

Since F is final in 𝒞, σ is unique and always exists. Also, since σ is
unique and always exist, the choice of φ is irrelevant: this same σ
works for all choices of φ for a given arbitrary Z. This proves that
σ_(𝒞_(A)) exists and is unique for all (φ, Z). Finally, since σ works
for all choices of φ, it works for those that satisfy the "equivalence
preservation" condition, and so does t: this means that (t, F) is indeed
a final object in 𝒬.

5.6)

Consider the category corresponding to endowing (as in Example 3.3) the
set ℤ⁺ of positive integers with the divisibility relation. Thus there
is exactly one morphism d → m in this category if and only if d divides
m without remainder; there is no morphism between d and m otherwise.
Show that this category has products and coproducts. What are their
’conventional’ names? [§VII.5.1]

Like example 3.3, this is a case of "category made from an order
relation over a set", since divisibility is an order relation
(reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive).

Let us remind the definition of categorical products and coproducts. We
consider some general category 𝒞.

An object A∏B is the product of two objects A and B iff there is a
unique morphism π_(A) (resp. π_(B)) from A∏B to A (resp. B), and for
every Z in 𝒞, and for every pair of morphisms f_(A) : Z → A and
f_(B) : Z → B, there exists a single morphism σ = f_(A)∏f_(B) such that
π_(A)σ = f_(A) and π_(B)σ = f_(B). This is summarized in the following
commutative diagram.

An object A∐B is the coproduct of two objects A and B iff there is a
unique morphism i_(A) (resp. i_(B)) from A (resp. B) into A∐B, and for
every Z in 𝒞, and for every pair of morphisms f_(A) : A → Z and
f_(B) : B → Z, there exists a single σ = f_(A)∐f_(B)) such that
σi_(A) = f_(A) and σi_(B) = f_(B). This is summarized in the following
commutative diagram.

We now return to our "divisibility order category". We write its objects
as simple integers, and the (if it exists, unique) morphism representing
"divisibility of m by n" as (n|m). The conventional name of the product
for this category is "greatest common divisor" (or "meet"), and of the
coproduct, "least common multiple" (or "join").

The following commutative diagrams represent this fact. Take two
arbitrary naturals m and n. Any number k which divides both m and n also
divides their GCD. Likewise, if k is a multiple of both n and m, then it
is a multiple of their LCM.

Redo Exercise 2.9 ("Show that if A ≃ A′ and B ≃ B′ , and further
A ∩ B = ∅ and A′ ∩ B′ = ∅, then A ∪ B ≃ A′ ∪ B′. Conclude that the
operation A∐B (as described in §1.4) is well-defined up to isomorphism")
this time using Proposition 5.4. (the unicity up-to-isomorphism of
terminal objects).

TODO, fix, since $\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}$ and
$\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A',B'}$ need to both be treated.

This is what we are give by the prompt:

with A ∪ B = A∐B and A′ ∪ B′ = A′∐B′ since A ∩ B = ∅ and A′ ∩ B′ = ∅.

We define $\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}$ as the "bicoslice category of A
and B over Set". Objects in this category are pairs of morphisms (f, g)
from A and B, respectively, into sets Z. They can be diagrammed as
follows.

Morphisms are defined between objects as

such that the following diagram commutes in Set

Let us call I the following object of $\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}$, where
A∐B is any choice of valid disjoint union of A and B:

By definition of a coproduct, we know that in such a configuration, a
morphism σ^(A, B) from this object into any other object of
$\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}$ exists and is unique, and so is the σ on
which it is based. This means that I is initial in
$\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}$.

TODO fix and explain

We observe that i_(A), i_(B), i_(A′) and i_(B′) are all injections, and
thus are post-cancellable, by maps π_(A), π_(B), π_(A′) and π_(B′)
(which are surjections).

f_(A′) = i_(A′) ∘ f_(A) and f_(B′) = i_(B′) ∘ f_(B) together define a
unique map f_(AB) from A∐B to A′∐B′.

We set arbitrary g_(A) : A′ → Z and g_(B) : B′ → Z; we have
g_(A) ∘ f_(A) = g_(A) ∘ i_(A′) ∘ f_(A) and
g_(B) ∘ f_(B) = g_(B) ∘ i_(B′) ∘ f_(B). These define a unique map from
A∐B to Z, which we’ll write g_(AB) ∘ f_(AB).

5.8)

Show that in every category 𝒞 the products A × B and B × A are
isomorphic, if they exist. (Hint: observe that they both satisfy the
universal property for the product of A and B, then use Proposition
5.4.)

Let us first remind the definition of the product of two sets. It is the
set made of all pairs of A and B (ordered sequences of two elements,
where the first element in the sequence comes from A and the second
comes from B) It is the structure such that the following diagram
commutes, and (f, g) is unique.

Now to extend the diagram to consider both A × B and B × A.

We seek to prove that given such a commutative diagram (with a unique
(f, g) and (g, f)), which we will call D, then we have A × B ≃ B × A.

We define 𝒞_(A, B) as the "bislice category of A and B over 𝒞". Objects
in this category are pairs of morphisms (f, g) from sets Z, into A and
B, respectively. They can be diagrammed as follows.

Morphisms are defined between objects as

such that the following diagram commutes in 𝒞:

We now define the following objects:

and

Using the diagram D defined above, and the definition of a product (ie,
that the maps from any Z to it in the appropriate configuration are
unique). We deduce that both A × B and B × A are final objects in
𝒞_(A, B). Finally, using Proposition 5.4, i.e., that final objects in a
category are unique up-to-isomorphism, we conclude that A × B ≃ B × A.

5.9)

Let 𝒞 be a category with products. Find a reasonable candidate for the
universal property that the product A × B × C of three objects of 𝒞
ought to satisfy, and prove that both (A × B) × C and A × (B × C)
satisfy this universal property. Deduce that (A × B) × C and A × (B × C)
are necessarily isomorphic.

Given 3 objects A, B, C of 𝒞. We propose the following universal
property that A × B × C should respect: for all objects Z of 𝒞, and
triplet of maps f, g, and h from Z to A, B and C respectively, there
exists a unique triplet-map (f, g, h) is unique such that the following
diagram commutes.

We will now show that both (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) satisfy this
universal property.

5.9.a)

We start with

and

From both of these universal products, we deduce the following
commutative diagram.

5.9.b)

We start with

and

From both of these universal products we deduce the following
commutative diagram:

5.9.c)

We now consider the 𝒞_(A, B, C) as the "trislice category of A, B and C
over 𝒞". Objects in this category are of the form:

Morphisms are defined between objects as:

such that there exists a σ making the following diagram commute in 𝒞:

We now define the following object:

and using the two universal properties we have shown above, we know that
necessarily (A × B) × C and A × (B × C) are terminal objects in
𝒞_(A, B, C). This is because they are final objects in respective
bislice categories, given that ((f, g), h) and (f, (g, h)) are both
unique; and we can compose p_(A) ∘ p_(A × B), etc, to get immediate
projections, making them final in the trislice category as well. To be
precise:

(((A × B) × C), p_(A) ∘ p_(A × B), p_(B) ∘ p_(A × B), p_(C))

((A × (B × C)), π_(A), π_(B) ∘ π_(B × C), π_(C) ∘ π_(B × C))

are both final objects in 𝒞_(A, B, C), as is shown by the following
commutative diagram, which is composed from the diagrams above:

We use Proposition 5.4 to deduce that (A × B) × C and A × (B × C), as
terminal objects in 𝒞_(A, B, C), are necessarily isomorphic. Therefore,
given this "associativity up-to-isomorphism" of a triple product, it is
legitimate to call A × B × C (with no parentheses) "the" (unique,
up-to-isomorphism) final object in 𝒞_(A, B, C).

5.10)

Push the envelope a little further still, and deﬁne products and
coproducts for families (i.e., indexed sets) of objects of a category.
Do these exist in Set? It is common to denote the product
A ×  ⋅  ⋅  ⋅  × A (n times) by A^(n).

Let ℱ be an (ordered) family of objects in some category 𝒞.

5.10.a)

A product of the elements of ℱ is defined as an object P of 𝒞 together
with a family of morphisms {p_(A) : P → A}_(A ∈ ℱ) such that for any
object Z and family of morphisms {f_(A) : Z → A}_(A ∈ ℱ), there exists a
unique morphism f : Z → P such that the following diagram commutes for
all A ∈ ℱ:

These exist in Set for all finite families of sets, however, for
infinite families of sets, their existence is conditional on the
(famous) axiom of choice (it is actually precisely the point of the
axiom of choice).

5.10.b)

A coproduct of the elements of ℱ is defined as an object C of 𝒞 together
with a family of morphisms {i_(A) : A → C}_(A ∈ ℱ) such that for any
object Z and family of morphisms {f_(A) : A → Z}_(A ∈ ℱ), there exists a
unique morphism f : C → Z such that the following diagram commutes for
all A ∈ ℱ:

These exist in Set for all families of sets, however, for infinite
families of sets, their existence is conditional on the axiom of choice.

5.11)

Let A, resp. B, be sets, endowed with equivalence relations ∼_(A), resp.
∼_(B). Define a relation ∼ on A × B by setting
(a₁, b₁) ∼ (a₂, b₂) ⇔ a₁∼_(A)a₂ and b₁∼_(B)b₂. (This is immediately seen
to be an equivalence relation.)

-   Use the universal property for quotients (§5.3) to establish that
    there are functions (A × B)/∼ → A/∼_(A), and (A × B)/∼ → B/∼_(B);

-   prove that (A × B)/∼, with these two functions, satisfies the
    universal property for the product of A/∼_(A) and B/∼_(B);

-   conclude (without further work) that
    (A × B)/∼  ≃ (A/∼_(A)) × (B/∼_(B)).

5.11.a)

First, we remind the universal property for quotients. Given an
equivalence relation ∼ over a set A, there is a single map π : A → A/∼
such that, for any map f : A → Z verifying f(a₁) = f(a₂) whenever
a₁ ∼ a₂ (i.e., the morphism f is "well-defined" for the equivalence
relation ∼), there exists a unique map $\overline{f} : A/\sim \to Z$
such that $f = \overline{f} \circ \pi$. This is summarized in the
following commutative diagram:

We now apply the universal property of products to obtain the following
commutative diagram:

We then consider a well-defined map f : (A × B) → Z (i.e.,
f(a₁, b₁) = f(a₂, b₂) whenever (a₁, b₁) ∼ (a₂, b₂)). We apply the
universal property of quotients to the relation ∼ defined over A × B. We
define the map π : A × B → (A × B)/∼ as π(a, b) = [(a, b)]_(∼). We
define the map $\overline{f} : (A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; Z$ as
$\overline{f}([(a,b)]_\sim) = f(a,b)$. We remind that such an f is
unique, and that $\overline{f} \circ \pi = f$.

We do a similar construction for A/∼_(A) with f_(A) and B/∼_(B) with
f_(B). We can do so since these maps are also well-defined. Indeed, we
have:

$$\begin{array}{l}
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
        (a_1, b_1) \sim (a_2, b_2) \\
        (a_1, b_1) \sim (a_2, b_2) \Rightarrow f(a_1, b_1) = f(a_2, b_2) \\
        f = f_A \circ p_A \\
        f = f_B \circ p_B
    \end{array}
    \right.
\cr \Rightarrow \\
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
        a_1 \sim_A a_2 \text{ and } b_1 \sim_B b_2 \\
        f_A(p_A(a_1, b_1)) = f_A(p_A(a_2, b_2)) \\
        f_B(p_B(a_1, b_1)) = f_B(p_B(a_2, b_2)) 
    \end{array}
    \right.
\cr \Rightarrow \\
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
        f_A(a_1) = f_A(a_2) \\
        f_B(b_1) = f_B(b_2) 
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{array}$$

The combination of all previous steps gives us the following commutative
diagram.

Let us recap a little what’s in diagram a little, to show that it is a
justified construction:

-   A × B is a product, and so we may obtain p_(A), p_(B), f_(A), and
    f_(B);

-   f is well-defined for the equivalence relation ∼, and so we may
    obtain $\overline{f}$ and π;

-   f_(A) is well-defined for the equivalence relation ∼_(A), and so we
    may obtain $\overline{f_A}$ and π_(A);

-   f_(B) is well-defined for the equivalence relation ∼_(B), and so we
    may obtain $\overline{f_B}$ and π_(B);

Therefore, we have the maps Π_(A) = π_(A) ∘ p_(A) ∈ (A × B) → A/∼_(A)
and Π_(B) = π_(B) ∘ p_(B) ∈ (A × B) → B/∼_(B). Π_(A) and Π_(B) are
well-defined because they are compositions of well-defined maps. For
π_(A) and π_(B), we know that the projector and unique function part (of
the universal property of quotients) are necessarily well-defined,
otherwise they wouldn’t compose to a well-defined map. As for p_(A) and
p_(B), they are well-defined because they are projections, and
projections are always well-defined.

Since Π_(A) and Π_(B) are well-defined, we can "quotient through" (i.e.,
use the universal property of quotient for) (A × B)/∼.

This gives us the following commutative diagram (compatible with the one
above, but it’s too messy to represent both at the same time):

These are precisely our functions
$\overline{\Pi_A} \in (A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; A/\sim_A$ and
$\overline{\Pi_B} \in (A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; B/\sim_B$, and they
are unique, as per the universal property of quotients.

5.11.b)

What we wish to prove now is that (A × B)/∼ is the product of A/∼_(A)
and B/∼_(B). Said otherwise, we wish to show that, for all Z, g_(A) and
g_(B) in the appropriate configuration, the following diagram commutes:

Using the fact that (A × B) is already a product, and studying maps
h_(A) and h_(B) from Z into A and B respectively, we can make the
following commutative diagram:

The internal parts of the diagram (except h_(A) and h_(B) which are
arbitrary, all other arrows are unique morphisms) force g_(A) and g_(B)
to commute with the rest of the diagram: any pairs of maps g_(A) and
g_(B) that make the diagram commute must necessarily be constrained by
the existing morphisms (as the composition of unique morphisms). Any
choice of maps g_(A) and g_(B) must respect g_(A) = π_(A) ∘ h_(A) and
g_(B) = π_(B) ∘ h_(B), for corresponding arbitrary (but inferred) h_(A)
and h_(B); said otherwise, maps g_(A) and g_(B) in this configuration
can only exist if they make the diagram commute. Therefore, we have
shown that (A × B)/∼ satisfies the universal property of the product of
A/∼_(A) and B/∼_(B), and we have (g_(A), g_(B)) = π ∘ (h_(A), h_(B))
(though it’s not shown on the above diagram, in order to improve
legibility).

5.11.c)

We know that elements that verify a common universal property are
terminal objects (of the same kind) in some comma category. Here, both
(A × B)/∼ and ((A/∼_(A)) × (B/∼_(B))) are final objects in the bislice
category $\text{\textbf{Set}}_{A,B}$. Since they are both final objects
in the same category, they are isomorphic.

Conclusion: ((A × B)/ ∼ ) ≃ ((A/∼_(A)) × (B/∼_(B)))

5.12)

Define notions of fibered products and coproducts, as terminal objects
of the categories 𝒞_(α, β), C^(α, β) considered in Example 3.10 (cf.
also Exercise 3.11), by stating carefully the corresponding universal
properties. As it happens, Set has both fibered products and coproducts.
Define these objects ’concretely’, in terms of naive set theory.
[II.3.9, III.6.10, III.6.11]

5.12.a)

We first define the fibered product (or "pullback"). We suggest the
reader goes to check section 3.11.3 of this exercises solutions document
for a refresher on the concept "fibered bislice category" 𝒞_(α, β). We
will use the same notation, i.e., fixing two morphisms α : A → C and
β : B → C (with common codomain) in a category 𝒞.

This means, for any generic object (Z, f, g) of 𝒞_(α, β), we have the
following diagram:

We first propose a candidate for what it means to be a "fibered
product", which we will be able to show is a final object in 𝒞_(α, β). A
fibered product P of A and B over C in a category 𝒞 is an object P
together with morphisms p_(A) : P → A and p_(B) : P → B such that for
any object Z in 𝒞 and morphisms f : Z → A and g : Z → B such that
α ∘ f = β ∘ g, there exists a unique morphism h : Z → P such that the
following diagram commutes:

We will now show that this object P induces a terminal object in
𝒞_(α, β); this boils down to showing that (P, p_(A), p_(B)) is final in
𝒞_(α, β). Let (Z, f, g) be an arbitrary object of 𝒞_(α, β). A morphism σ
from (Z, f, g) to (P, p_(A), p_(B)) is a "raising" of a morphism
h : Z → P such that p_(A) ∘ h = f and p_(B) ∘ h = g. This raising σ is
unique if and only if h is unique. Since P is presupposed to verify the
universal property, such an h, if it exists, is indeed unique.
Therefore, (P, p_(A), p_(B)) is final (a fortiori terminal) in 𝒞_(α, β).

5.12.b)

We now define the fibered coproduct (or "pushout"). We suggest the
reader goes to check section 3.11.4 of this exercises solutions document
for a refresher on the "fibered bicoslice category" C^(α, β). We will
use the same notation, i.e., fixing two morphisms α : C → A and
β : C → B (with common domain) in a category 𝒞.

This means, for any generic object (f, g, Z) of C^(α, β), we have the
following diagram:

We first propose a candidate for what it means to be a "fibered
coproduct", which we will be able to show is an initial object in
C^(α, β). A fibered coproduct P of A and B over C in a category 𝒞 is an
object P together with morphisms p_(A) : A → P and p_(B) : B → P such
that for any object Z in 𝒞 and morphisms f : A → Z and g : B → Z such
that f ∘ α = g ∘ β, there exists a unique morphism h : P → Z such that
the following diagram commutes:

We will now show that this object P induces an initial object in
C^(α, β); this boils down to showing that (i_(A), i_(B), P) is initial
in C^(α, β). Let (f, g, Z) be an arbitrary object of C^(α, β). A
morphism σ from (i_(A), i_(B), P) to (f, g, Z) is a "raising" of a
morphism h : P → Z such that h ∘ i_(A) = f and h ∘ i_(B) = g. This
raising σ is unique if and only if h is unique. Since P is presupposed
to verify the universal property, such an h, if it exists, is indeed
unique. Therefore, (i_(A), i_(B), P) is initial (a fortiori terminal) in
C^(α, β).

5.12.c)

(I wouldn’t have come up with this without Wikipedia as a hint...)

In Set, the fibered product (pullback) of (A, α) and (B, β) over C, is a
special subset of the cartesian product A × B that registers some extra
information, pertaining to the functions α and β. We write this object
as
P = A×_(α, C, β)B = A×_(C)B = {(a, b) ∈ A × B ∣ α(a) = β(b)}
.

Concretely, this can also be expressed as
P = ⋃_(c ∈ α(A) ∩ β(B))α^( − 1)[{c}] × β^( − 1)[{c}]
. This is the set of all pairs (of inputs) (a, b) such that α(a) = β(b).
Let us show this is the case with a simple example.

Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {w, x, y, z}, and C = {l, m, n, p}. We define
α : A → C as {(1, m), (2, m), (3, n)}, and β : B → C as
{(w, l), (x, m), (y, n), (z, n)}. We have α(A) = {m, n} and
β(B) = {l, m, n}, therefore α(A) ∩ β(B) = {m, n}. The fibered product is
then:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
P &=& (\alpha^{-1}[\{m\}] \times \beta^{-1}[\{m\}]) \; \cup \; (\alpha^{-1}[\{n\}] \times \beta^{-1}[\{n\}]) \\
  &=& \{ \{1,2\} \times \{x\} \} \; \cup \; \{ \{3\} \times \{y,z\} \} \\
  &=& \{ (1,x), (2,x) \} \; \cup \; \{ (3,y), (3,z) \} \\
  &=& \{ (1,x), (2,x), (3,y), (3,z) \}
\end{array}$$

A simple way to verify this is to verify that for each pair (a, b) in P,
α(a) = β(b), and that no such other pairs are missing.

5.12.d)

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/3021738/pushout-in-the-category-of-sets-proof

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2240882/understanding-an-example-of-a-pushout-in-mathbfset

In Set, the fibered coproduct (pushout) of (α, A) and (β, B) over C is a
special quotient of the disjoint union A ⊔ B that registers some extra
information, pertaining to the functions α and β. We write this object
as
P = A⊔_(α, C, β)B = A⊔_(C)B = (A ⊔ B)/∼
, where ∼ is an equivalence relation defined as ∼  := cl_(eq)(R), the
equivalence closure of the relation
R = {((0, a), (1, b)) ∈ (A ⊔ B) × (A ⊔ B) ∣ ∃c ∈ C, a = α(c) and b = β(c)}
(i.e., two elements are equivalent if they are both the output of some
common c, or if there is any chain of such equivalences between them).

(We remind that the equivalence closure, if elements of the set are seen
as vertices and the relation pairs as edges of a graph, can be thought
of, visually, as "completing the cliques" of each connected component in
the graph, including self-loops; hence the idea that if there is any
path between two elements, then they are equivalent and should be
directly linked. We also remind that this corresponds uniquely to a
partition of the set; the elements of which, called cosets, are what
allow us to do an algebraic quotient.)

The fibered coproduct is the set P obtained by taking the disjoint union
A ⊔ B and identifying a ∈ A with b ∈ B if there exists c ∈ C such that
α(c) = a and β(c) = b (and all identifications that follow to keep the
equality relation an equivalence relation). There is no more concrete of
a definition than this; it really boils down to identifying elements
with a common preimage element through α^( − 1)(A) and β^( − 1)(B) in C,
via an equivalence relation.

Let us show this is the case with a simple example. We will keep the
elements of A and B distinct in order to remove the visual clutter that
comes with the (0, ...) and (1, ...) of the general disjoint union.

Let A = {1, 2, 3}, B = {w, x, y, z}, and C = {l, m, n}. We define
α : C → A as {(l, 1), (m, 1), (n, 2)}, and β : C → B as
{(l, x), (m, y), (n, z)}. We have:

-   α^( − 1)({1}) = {l, m} and β^( − 1)({x}) = {l}, so 1 ∼ x;

-   α^( − 1)({1}) = {l, m} and β^( − 1)({y}) = {m}, so 1 ∼ y, and by
    closure, 1 ∼ x ∼ y;

-   α^( − 1)({2}) = {n} and β^( − 1)({z}) = {n}, so 2 ∼ z;

-   α^( − 1)({3}) = ∅ and β^( − 1)({w}) = ∅, so you might think that
    3 ∼ w, however, since there is no c ∈ C such that α(c) = 3 and
    β(c) = w, we have 3 ≁ w;

This information corresponds to the following partition of A ⊔ B:
{{1, x, y}, {2, z}, {3}, {w}}. The fibered coproduct is then:

$$\begin{array}{lll}
P &=& (A \sqcup B) / \sim \\
  &=& \{1,2,3,w,x,y,z\} / \sim \\
  &=& \{\{1,x,y\}, \{2,z\}, \{3\}, \{w\}\} \\
  &=& \{[1], [2], [3], [w]\}
\end{array}$$

A way to verify this is to verify that each equivalence class is
disjoint, and that all pairs of elements within an equivalence class are
related by ∼ (by applying α or β where appropriate and drawing the graph
of the relation).

Chapter II)

Section 1)

1.1)

Write a careful proof that every group is the group of isomorphisms of a
groupoid. In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of
some object in some category.

Let us first remind the definition of a groupoid: a groupoid is a
category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.

(Side-note: by "group of isomorphisms", what Aluffi rather meant is
"group of isomorphisms (of the single object) in a groupoid (that has a
single object)". Otherwise, with multiple objects, things fail: for
example, there are multiple identities, one per object, not universally
applicable to each object. This is precisely why the notion of
"groupoid" was invented, to extend the notion of group in such a way.)

Let (G,  ⋅ ) be a group, i.e., some form of algebraic structure with a
set of elements G and a binary operation ⋅ which is associative,
unitary, and invertible. We want to show that there exists a groupoid 𝒞
such that (G,  ⋅ ) is the group of isomorphisms of 𝒞.

Let us define 𝒞 as follows:

-   There is a single object X in 𝒞, and its elements are the elements
    of G (we could call X "G", of course, but we’ll be distinct for
    pedagogy’s sake). Our goal is to prove that Hom(X, X) is isomorphic
    to G, and thus is itself a group.

-   For any element g of X, there is a unique morphism f_(g) ∈ Hom(X, X)
    such that ∀x ∈ X, f_(g)(x) = (x ↦ g ⋅ x).

-   Composition of morphisms is defined as follows:
    f_(a) ∘ f_(b) = (x ↦ a ⋅ (b ⋅ x)) = (x ↦ (a ⋅ b) ⋅ x) = f_(a ⋅ b) .

-   There is an identity morphism id_(X) = (x → e ⋅ x), with e the
    identity element of G, and
    ∀f ∈ Hom(X, X), f ∘ id_(X) = f = id_(X) ∘ f.

-   It is immediate to see that these morphisms are associative since
    (G,  ⋅ ) is associative. Take f_(a), f_(b), and f_(c) in Hom(X, X),
    for a, b, c ∈ X:
    (f_(a)f_(b))f_(c) = (x → ((a ⋅ b) ⋅ c)x) = (x → (a ⋅ (b ⋅ c))x) = f_(a)(f_(b)f_(c)).

-   Every such morphism has an inverse, namely,
    f_(g^( − 1)) = (x ↦ g^( − 1) ⋅ x) which by definition of a group
    necessarily exists. It is easy to verify that
    f_(g) ∘ f_(g^( − 1)) = f_(g^( − 1)) ∘ f_(g) = f_(g ⋅ g^( − 1)) = f_(g^( − 1) ⋅ g) = (x ↦ x = id_(X)) .

This is a groupoid, because, it is a category (composition,
associativity, identity) where every morphism is an isomorphism (every
morphism has an inverse), and the group of isomorphisms of (the
single-object category) 𝒞, here Hom(X, X), is precisely isomorphic to
(G,  ⋅ ).

1.2)

Consider the ’sets of numbers’ listed in §1.1, and decide which are made
into groups by conventional operations such as + and ⋅. Even if the
answer is negative (for example: (ℝ,  ⋅ ) is not a group), see if
variations on the definition of these sets lead to groups (for example,
(ℝ^(*),  ⋅ ) is a group, cf. §1.4). [§1.2]

I suppose Aluffi is referring to §I.1.1, and not §(II.)1.1. In there he
mentions:

-   ℕ: the set of natural numbers (that is, nonnegative integers);

-   ℤ: the set of integers;

-   ℚ: the set of rational numbers;

-   ℝ: the set of real numbers;

-   ℂ: the set of complex numbers.

Let us go through these sets one by one:

-   ℕ: (ℕ,  + ) is not a group (needs negative numbers, x + 5 = 0 has no
    solution), and neither is (ℕ,  ⋅ ) (e.g., 5 ⋅ x = 1 has no solution
    in ℕ).

-   ℤ: (ℤ,  + ) is a group, but (ℤ,  ⋅ ) is not because it is not
    invertible (e.g., 2 ⋅ x = 1 has no solution in ℤ).

-   ℚ: (ℚ,  + ) is a group, but (ℚ,  ⋅ ) is not because it is not fully
    invertible (e.g., 0 ⋅ x = 1 has no solution in ℚ). However, remove 0
    from (ℚ,  ⋅ ) and it becomes a group.

-   ℝ: (ℝ,  + ) is a group, but (ℝ,  ⋅ ) is not because it is not fully
    invertible (e.g., 0 ⋅ x = 1 has no solution in ℝ). However, remove 0
    from (ℝ,  ⋅ ) and it becomes a group.

-   ℂ: (ℂ,  + ) is a group, but (ℂ,  ⋅ ) is not because it is not fully
    invertible (e.g., 0 ⋅ x = 1 has no solution in ℂ). However, remove 0
    from (ℂ,  ⋅ ) and it becomes a group.

We can see that (ℕ,  + ) is not a group, but (ℤ,  + ), (ℚ,  + ),
(ℝ,  + ), and (ℂ,  + ) are all groups. Also, (ℕ,  ⋅ ), (ℤ,  ⋅ ),
(ℚ,  ⋅ ), (ℝ,  ⋅ ), and (ℂ,  ⋅ ) are not groups. However, (ℚ^(*),  ⋅ ),
(ℝ^(*),  ⋅ ), and (ℂ^(*),  ⋅ ) are groups.

1.3)

Prove that (gh)^( − 1) = h^( − 1)g^( − 1) for all elements g, h of a
group G.

(gh)(h^( − 1)g^( − 1)) = g(hh^( − 1))g^( − 1) = geg^( − 1) = gg^( − 1) = e
(h^( − 1)g^( − 1))(gh) = h^( − 1)(g^( − 1)g)h = h^( − 1)eh = h^( − 1)h = e

Therefore, h^( − 1)g^( − 1) is a 2-sided inverse for gh, and since the
inverse of an element in a group is unique,
(gh)^( − 1) = (h^( − 1)g^( − 1))

1.4)

Suppose that g² = e for all elements g of a group G; prove that G is
commutative.

If forallg ∈ G, g² = e, then every element is its own inverse, i.e.,
multiply by g^( − 1) on the left (or right), and we have
∀g ∈ G, g = g^( − 1). Let be a, b ∈ G. Then, we have
ba = (ba)^( − 1) = a^( − 1)b^( − 1) = ab, which is the definition of
commutativity. Therefore, G is commutative.

1.5)

The ’multiplication table’ of a group is an array compiling the results
of all multiplications g ⋅ h (with the value on each row being the left
operand, and the value on each column being the right operand; of course
the table depends on the order in which the elements are listed in the
top row and leftmost column). Prove that every row and every column of
the multiplication table of a group contains all elements of the group
exactly once (like Sudoku diagrams!).

Another way to phrase this question is "prove that every element of the
group can be reached in a single operation from any other (on the left,
or on the right, both work)". Written in function notation, this means:

∀a, b ∈ G, ∃g_(r), g_(c) ∈ G, b = g_(r) ⋅ a and b = a ⋅ g_(c)

For every element a, we can reach the identity with a^( − 1) (on either
side). Every element b can then be reached from the identity by
multiplying it (on either side). We just have to pick the same side both
times to find either g_(r) = b ⋅ a^( − 1) and g_(c) = a^( − 1) ⋅ b.
Since the group is closed under "multiplication", both these elements
are guaranteed to exist.

This implies that every row and every column of the multiplication table
of a group contains all elements of the group exactly once, since any
element can be reached in a single multiplication (i.e., there as many
possible inputs (1 sided operand) as possible outputs (i.e., applying an
operand is an injection) and all outputs are reached (it’s also a
surjection)). This also implies that the multiplication table is a
"Latin square", which is a square array of |G| symbols, each occurring
exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.

1.6)

Prove that there is only one possible multiplication table for G if G
has exactly 1, 2, or 3 elements. Analyze the possible multiplication
tables for groups with exactly 4 elements, and show that there are two
distinct tables, up to reordering the elements of G. Use these tables to
prove that all groups with  ≤ 4 elements are commutative.

These multiplication tables are usually called "Cayley tables".

1.6.a) 1-element group

For the unique table of the trivial group (only 1 element); e is
necessarily its own inverse. Some examples of this group are ({0},  + )
or ({1},  × ). This group is trivially commutative.

   ⋅   e
  --- ---
   e   e

1.6.b) 2-element group

For the unique table of the group with 2 elements; both elements are
necessarily their own inverse (or else there would be no e which is
necessarily a self-inverse). Some examples of this group are
({1,  − 1},  × ), or (ℤ₂,  + ) (two-hour clock with addition). This
group is commutative, since, like in the exercise 1.4, every element is
its own inverse.

   ⋅   e   a
  --- --- ---
   e   e   a
   a   a   e

1.6.c) 3-element group

For the unique table of the group with 3 elements; the 3 elements cannot
all be their own inverses, because if 2 elements are their own inverse,
the third one cannot have an inverse. Another way of seeing this is the
below: no matter the value given for each ?, this cannot be a Latin
square (if we put two e’s then we have multiple inverses, so we can
deduce that a and b are inverses, and then we a = b; if we put two a’s,
we lose associativity (e.g.: (aa)b = eb = b ≠ a(ab) = aa = e); etc).

   ⋅   e   a   b
  --- --- --- ---
   e   e   a   b
   a   a   e   ?
   b   b   ?   e

Instead, the 2 non-identity elements are necessarily inverses of each
other. Some examples of this group are
$(\{1, j, \overline{j} \}, \times)$ (where j = e^(τ/3) is a complex
number called the third root of unity), or (ℤ₃,  + ) (three-hour clock
with addition). This group is commutative because the identity
necessarily commutes with everything, and inverses necessarily commute
together, so here, all elements commute.

      ⋅          e          a       a^( − 1)
  ---------- ---------- ---------- ----------
      e          e          a       a^( − 1)
      a          a       a^( − 1)      e
   a^( − 1)   a^( − 1)      e          a

1.6.d) 4-element groups

For the case where |G| = 4, we have two possibilities.

The first one is a table where every element is a self-inverse. This
gives you a group that is isomorphic to (ℤ₂ × ℤ₂,  + ) (the Klein
four-group, a torus made up of 2 two-hour clocks). Note that the
permutations of the elements of the group give the same table, so there
is only one table for this group up to reordering. It is commutative for
the same reason as exercise 1.4.

   ⋅   e   a   b   c
  --- --- --- --- ---
   e   e   a   b   c
   a   a   e   c   b
   b   b   c   e   a
   c   c   b   a   e

The second possibility where one element other than the identity is its
own inverse, and the other two are mutual inverses. This gives you a
group that is isomorphic to (ℤ₄,  + ) (a four-hour clock with addition,
where 1 and  − 1 are mutual inverses, and 0 and 2 are their own
inverse). Note that the permutations of the elements of the group give
the same table, so there is only one table for this group up to
reordering.

Since the identity and respective inverses commute, all that’s left is
to check the commutativity of the self-inverse element a with both of
the mutual-inverses elements b and c. In this case, it is because there
is "only one option left" in the Latin square that we get commutativity:
e.g., a ⋅ b cannot equal e since they are not inverses, cannot equal a
since b ≠ e, cannot equal b since a ≠ e, so we must have a ⋅ b = c. The
same reasoning can be applied to b ⋅ a to get c (hence a ⋅ b = b ⋅ a).
With a relabelling, we apply this reasoning to a ⋅ c to get b and to
c ⋅ a to get b (hence a ⋅ c = c ⋅ a). With this, we have proven
commutativity.

   ⋅   e   a   b   c
  --- --- --- --- ---
   e   e   a   b   c
   a   a   e   c   b
   b   b   c   a   e
   c   c   b   e   a

1.6.e) Conclusion and remark

With that, we’ve proven that all groups of order  ≤ 4 are commutative.

(Note that the commutativity can also be "seen" in all these tables by
the fact that they are their own transpose.)

1.7)

Prove Corollary 1.11: Let g be an element of finite order, and let
n ∈ ℤ. Then g^(n) = e ⇔ ∃k ∈ ℤ, n = k|g| (n is a multiple of |g|).

By Lemma 1.10, if g^(n) = e, then |g| divides n. Therefore,
∃k ∈ ℤ, n = k|g|.

For the converse, we suppose ∃k ∈ ℤ, n = k|g|. By definition of the
order of a group element, g^(|g|) = e, so
g^(n) = g^(|g|k) = (g^(|g|))^(k) = e^(k) = e. Hence, g^(n) = e.

1.8)

Let G be a finite group, with exactly one element f of order 2. Prove
that Π_(g ∈ G)g = f.

I had some trouble, so I checked online and found this, meaning that the
group probably needs to be not just finite but also abelian:

https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2550052/let-g-be-a-finite-abelian-group-with-exactly-one-element-of-order-2-denoted

(A couple of notes: since f² = e ⇔ f = f^( − 1), it also means that f is
the only self-inverse (involution) in G. Also, the order of operation is
not given: this gives us a hint that the property (Π_(g ∈ G) g)² = e
does not rely on the order of operations.)

Since f is the only element which is a self-inverse of order 2, e is the
only self-inverse of order 1, we have that for all other elements a g in
G, g is not its own inverse. This means that the product of all elements
of G is a product of pairs of inverses, which cancel out to the identity
(given commutativity), except for the self-inverse f which remains.
Therefore, Π_(g ∈ G)g = f.

1.9)

Let G be a finite group, of order n, and let m be the number of elements
g ∈ G of order exactly 2. Prove that n − m is odd. Deduce that if n is
even then G necessarily contains elements of order 2.

(This would be trivial if we could use Lagrange’s theorem.)

Let us consider the set of elements of G of order 2,
M = {g ∈ G ∣ |g| = 2}, with |M| = m. We know that for all g ∈ M,
g = g^( − 1). This means that M is the set of self-inverse elements (not
counting e). This means that G − M contains only pairs of inverses (with
k such pairs), and the self-inverse e, so has its cardinal can be
written |G − M| = |G| − |M| = n − m = 2k + 1, i.e., it is an odd number.

If |G| = n is even, then it can be written as 2l for some l ∈ ℕ with
l > k. Consequently |M| = |G| − (n − m) = 2l − (2k + 1) = 2(l − k) − 1,
which is odd, and  > 0 since l > k. Therefore, G necessarily contains at
least 1 element of order 2.

1.10)

Suppose the order of g is odd. What can you say about the order of g² ?

We write |g| = 2k + 1 since it is odd.

g^(|g|) = e ⇒ (g²)^(|g|) = (g^(|g|))² = e² = e

By Corollary 1.11,
(g²)^(|g|) = (g²)^(2k + 1) = e ⇔ ∃l ∈ ℕ, |g| = 2k + 1 = l|g²|. Since |g|
is odd, both l and |g²| must be odd.

1.11)

Prove that for all g, h in a group G, |gh| = |hg|. (Hint: prove that
|aga^( − 1)| = |g| for all a, g ∈ G.)

Let a, g ∈ G.

$$\begin{array}{ll}
(aga^{-1})^{|g|} &= (aga^{-1})(aga^{-1})...(aga^{-1}) \\
                 &= ag(a^{-1}a)g(a^{-1}a)g...ga^{-1} \\
                 &= ag^{|g|}a^{-1} \\
                 &= aea^{-1} \\
                 &= (aa^{-1}) \\
                 &= e
\end{array}$$

By Lemma 1.10, |aga^( − 1)| is a divisor of |g|.

By definition, (aga^( − 1))^(|aga^( − 1)|) = e. However, similarly to
above, (aga^( − 1))^(|aga^( − 1)|) = ag^(|aga^( − 1)|)a^( − 1). So we
have ag^(|aga^( − 1)|)a^( − 1) = e; then, multiplying on the left by
a^( − 1) and right by a, we get g^(|aga^( − 1)|) = e. By Lemma 1.10, |g|
is a divisor of |aga^( − 1)|.

Since the divisibility relation is an order relation (antisymmetric),
the only time two numbers can be mutually divisors of each other is if
we’re in the reflexive case (i.e., they are equal). Therefore,
|g| = |aga^( − 1)|.

Applying this identity to the elements g → gh with a → h, we have
|gh| = |(h)(gh)(h^( − 1))| = |hg|

1.12)

In the group of invertible 2 × 2 matrices, consider
$g = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$,
$h = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$. Verify that
|g| = 4, |h| = 3, and |gh| = ∞. [§1.6]

We remind call that the neutral element for 2D square matrix
multiplication is the identity matrix I₂.

$$g^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$g^4 = (g^2)^2
    = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} -1 & 0 \\ 0 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix}  1 & 0 \\ 0 &  1 \end{pmatrix}
    = I_2$$

$$h^2 = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix} 
    = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}$$

$$h^3 = h^2 h
    = \begin{pmatrix} -1 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
    = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
    = I_2$$

We will now prove by induction that
$\forall n \geq 1, P(n): (gh)^n = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$.

Initiatialization:

$$gh = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & -1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ -1 & -1 \end{pmatrix}
   = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$

True for n = 1.

Inheritance:

We suppose P(n) true for a specific n, we’ll show that P(n + 1) holds.

$$(gh)^{n+1} = (gh)^n(gh)
       = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & n \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}
       = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & (n+1) \\ 0 & 1 \end{pmatrix}$$
Therefore P(n + 1) is true. This prives inheritance.

By induction, P(n) is true for all n ≥ 1.

Therefore, there exists no n ≥ 1 such that (gh)^(n) = I₂, hence
|gh| = ∞.

1.13)

Give an example showing that |gh| is not necessarily equal to
lcm(|g|,|h|), even if g and h commute. [§1.6, 1.14]

We take the 6-hour clock Z₆, and g = h = [3]₆, the equivalence class of
3 modulo 6. We have g² = h² = gh = hg = [3]₆ + [3]₆ = [6]₆ = [0]₆, so
|g| = |h| = 2 and |gh| = 1. However, lcm(|g|,|h|) = 2 ≠ |gh| = 1

1.14)

As a counterpoint to Exercise 1.13, prove that if g and h commute, and
gcd(|g|,|h|) = 1 (they are coprime), then |gh| = |g||h|. (Hint: let
N = |gh|; then g^(N) = (h^( − 1))^(N). What can you say about this
element?) [§1.6, 1.15, §IV.2.5]

First, we remark that for any x ∈ G, x^(N) = e ⇔ e = (x^( − 1))^(N), so
|x| = |x^( − 1)|.

We have that gcd(|g|,|h|) = 1, and we know that
|g||h| = gcd(|g|,|h|)lcm(|g|,|h|) so we have |g||h| = lcm(|g|,|h|).

Let N = |gh|. Then, given that (gh)^(N) = e, that g and h commute, and
multiplying by (h^( − 1))^(N) on the right of both side, we have
(gh)^(N)(h^( − 1))^(N) = g^(N)h^(N)(h^( − 1))^(N) = g^(N)(hh^( − 1))^(N) = g^(N) = e(h^( − 1))^(N) = (h^( − 1))^(N).
Therefore, g^(N) = (h^( − 1))^(N) = f.

We now study f^(|g|) and f^(|h|).

We have f^(|g|) = (g^(N))^(|g|) = g^(N|g|) = e.

Similarly,
e = h^(|h|) = (h^( − 1))^(|h|) = ((h^( − 1))^(|h|))^(N) = ((h^( − 1))^(N))^(|h|) = f^(|h|)
(by our initial remark).

Therefore, M = |f| = |g^(N)| = |(h^( − 1))^(N)| = |h^(N)| divides both
|g| and |h|. Since |g| and |h| are coprime, M = 1. Therefore
f = g^(N) = e, so N = |gh| is a multiple of |g| and
f = (h^( − 1))^(N) = e so N = |gh| is a multiple of |h^( − 1)| = |h|.
Since |g| and |h| are coprime, we can further say that |gh| is a
multiple of their LCM/product |g||h| (using, for example, the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic).

Using Proposition 1.14 (i.e, if gh = hg, then |gh| divides
lcm(|g|,|h|)), we can also tell that N = |gh| divides
lcm(|g|,|h|) = |g||h|.

Putting both results together using the antisymmetry of the divisibility
relation, we have N = |gh| = |g||h|.

Let G be a commutative group, and let g ∈ G be an element of maximal
finite order: that is, such that if h ∈ G has finite order then
|h| ≤ |g|. Prove that in fact if h has finite order in G then |h|
divides |g|. (Hint: argue by contradiction. If |h| is finite but does
not divide |g|, then there is a prime integer p such that |g| = p^(m)r,
|h| = p^(n)s, with r and s relatively prime to p, and m < n. Use
Exercise 1.14 (the fact that the order of the product of two elements
with coprime order is equal to the product of their orders) to compute
the order of g^(p^(m))h^(s).) [§2.1, 4.11, IV.6.15]

We suppose that |h| is finite but does not divide |g|. Using the
fundamental theorem of arithmetic, if |h| doesn’t divide |g|, then it
has at least one prime factor that |g| does not have. Then, there is a
prime integer p such that |g| = p^(m)r, |h| = p^(n)s, with r and s
(potentially composite), both independently coprime with p, and
0 ≤ m < n.

We know from exercise 1.14 that if 2 elements a and b commute (which is
always the case in a commutative group like here), if the two elements
have coprime order, then |ab| = |a||b|.

The order |x^(k)| of x^(k), is $\frac{|x|}{\text{gcd}(|x|, k)}$,
assuming |x| is finite (Proposition 1.13).

We study g^(p^(m))h^(s).

The order of g^(p^(m)) is
$\frac{|g|}{\text{gcd}(|g|, p^m)} = \frac{p^m r}{p^m} = r$ because p^(m)
divides |g|.

Similarly, the order of h^(s) is
$|h|/\text{gcd}(|h|, s) = \frac{p^n s}{s} = p^n$ because s divides |h|.

Since G is a commutative group, g^(p^(m)) and h^(s) commute. By Exercise
1.14,
|g^(p^(m))h^(s)| = |g^(p^(m))||h^(s)| = p^(n)r = p^(n − m)(p^(m)r) = p^(n − m)|g| > |g|.

This is a contradiction with the fact that |g| has maximal finite order.
Therefore, our assumption that |h| does not divide |g| must be false.

Conclusion: if G is an abelian group, g ∈ G has maximal finite order,
and h ∈ G has finite order in G, then |h| divides |g|.

2.1)

One can associate an n × n matrix M_(σ) with a permutation σ ∈ S_(n), by
letting the entry at (i, σ(i)) be 1, and letting all other entries be 0.
For example, the matrix corresponding to the permutation

$$\sigma =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        1 & 2 & 3 \\
        3 & 1 & 2
    \end{pmatrix}
\in S_3$$

would be

$$M_\sigma =
    \begin{pmatrix}
        0 & 0 & 1 \\
        0 & 1 & 0 \\
        1 & 0 & 0
    \end{pmatrix}$$

Prove that, with this notation, M_(στ) = M_(σ)M_(τ) for all σ, τ ∈ S_(n)
, where the product on the right is the ordinary product of matrices.

We first notice that we can write down the formal expression of M_(σ),
as the Krocker delta δ_(iσ(i)). We know that the product of two
Kronecker deltas is the Kronecker delta of the product of the indices;
namely, δ_(ij)δ_(jk) = δ_(ik). Therefore, we have that the product of
two matrices
M_(σ)M_(τ) = δ_(iσ(i))δ_(σ(i)τ(σ(i))) = δ_(iτ(σ(i))) = M_(στ), as
desired.

2.2)

Prove that if d ≤ n then S_(n) contains elements of order d.

We will use strong induction on n.

Initialization: for S₁, the case is trivial (the identity element has
order 1). For S₂, we saw that this group was necessarily isomorphic to
ℤ₂, which has the identity, and one element of order 2.

Heredity: For some k ∈ ℕ, we suppose that the property is true for all
d ≤ k. We will show that it is true for k + 1. Keeping the last element
fixed, we see that the portion of S_(k + 1) that can permute is
isomorphic to S_(k): by our hypothesis, it thus has elements of order d
for all d ≤ k. We just need to show that we can find an element of order
k + 1 in S_(k + 1).

We take the a cyclic permutation of all elements (which acts like a
Caesar cypher of distance parameter 1): each i > 1 is mapped to to
i − 1, and 1 is mapped to k + 1. Let us prove that this permutation has
order k + 1.

We can see that the cycle of this permutation is
1 → k + 1 → k → k − 1 → … → 1, which has length k + 1.

We now show that the order of any cyclic permutation is the length of
the cycle. Let be S_(n) a permutation group and C a cycle in it,
generated by a permutation σ. We denote elements of the cycle as
c₁, c₂, …, c_(m) with m ≤ n such that the cycle can be expressed as
c₁ → c₂ → … → c_(m) → c₁. We have that ∀j ∈ [[1, m]], σ⁰(c_(j)) = c_(j),
trivially. Then, we have σ¹(c_(j)) = c_([j]_(m) + 1) (meaning j modulo m
plus 1), and so on. We see that σ^(n − 1)(c_(j)) = c_([j]_(m) + n − 1),
and σ^(n)(c_(j)) = c_([j]_(m) + n) = c_([j]_(m)) = c_(j). Therefore, the
order of σ is m, the length of the cycle.

Therefore, we have shown that S_(k + 1) has cyclic permutations of
length k + 1, and thus elements of order k + 1, which completes the
proof.

2.3)

For every positive integer n, find an element of order n in S_(ℕ).

From the previous exercise, it is clear that any cyclic permutation of
length n is such an element.

2.4)

Define a homomorphism D₈ → S₄ by labeling vertices of a square, as we
did for a triangle in §2.2. List the 8 permutations in the image of this
homomorphism.

We first write the dihedral group D₈ as the group of symmetries of a
square. We label the vertices of the square as A, B, C, D, in a
clockwise manner. We use 2 × 2 matrices with these labels to represent
the symmetries of the square, and we have that the elements of D₈ are:

$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{bmatrix}
A & B \\
D & C
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Identity} \\
\begin{bmatrix}
B & C \\
A & D
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Rotation by } 90^\circ \\
\begin{bmatrix}
C & D \\
B & A
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Rotation by } 180^\circ \\
\begin{bmatrix}
D & A \\
C & B
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Rotation by } 270^\circ \\
\begin{bmatrix}
A & D \\
B & C
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the diagonal } AC \\
\begin{bmatrix}
C & B \\
D & A
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the diagonal } BD \\
\begin{bmatrix}
D & C \\
A & B
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the horizontal axis } \\
\begin{bmatrix}
B & A \\
C & D
\end{bmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the vertical axis }
\end{aligned}$$
Now, using the 2 × n notation for permutations, we can write the
corresponding permutations in S₄ as:

$$\begin{aligned}
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
A & B & C & D
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Identity} \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
B & C & D & A
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Rotation by } 90^\circ \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
C & D & A & B
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Rotation by } 180^\circ \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
D & A & B & C
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Rotation by } 270^\circ \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
A & D & C & B
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the diagonal } AC \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
C & B & A & D
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the diagonal } BD \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
D & C & B & A
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the horizontal axis } \\
\begin{pmatrix}
A & B & C & D \\
B & A & D & C
\end{pmatrix} & \rightarrow \text{Reflection over the vertical axis }
\end{aligned}$$
Note that there exist other permutations which are not in the image of
this homomorphism, such as the transposition (AB), which is not a
symmetry of the square. This homomorphism is thus injective, but not
bijective.

2.5)

Describe generators and relations for all dihedral groups D_(2n). (Hint:
let x be the reflection about a line through the center of a regular
n-gon and a vertex, and let y be counterclockwise rotation by 2π/n. The
group D_(2n) will be generated by x and y, subject to three relations.
To see that these relations really determine D_(2n), use them to show
that any product x^(i₁)y^(i₂)x^(i₃)y^(i₄)… equals x^(i)y^(j) for some i,
j with 0 ≤ i ≤ 1, 0 ≤ j < n.)

Two of the relations are very easy to see: x² = e (for any axial
symmetry flip x) and y^(n) = e (for any n-rotation y). Another hint
(given at the bottom of page 52, as done on an imaginary pentagon) tells
us to study yxyx (hinting that it is equal to e).

We first note that x^( − 1) = x since any axial symmetry is an
involution. Geometrically speaking, we can see that the operation
x^( − 1)yx is a rotation by 2π/n in the opposite direction to y. We can
thus write x^( − 1)yx = y^( − 1), and thus yxyx = e. This is our 3rd
relation, which we can also rewrite as
yx =  = x^( − 1)y^( − 1) = xy^(n − 1).

We can now write any element of D_(2n) as x^(i)y^(j) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 1,
0 ≤ j < n. Any power of x reduces to e (if the exponent is even) or x
(if the exponent is odd), any power k of y reduces to y^([k]_(n)), and
any yx term sandwiched between an x and a y terms can be changed to
xy^(n − 1) in order to reduce with the x (or e) on the left, and the
y^([k]_(n)) on the right. Through this algorithm, we can always get an
element of the form x^(i)y^(j) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 1, 0 ≤ j < n.

2.6)

For every positive integer n construct a group containing two elements
g, h such that |g| = 2, |h| = 2, and |gh| = n. (Hint: for n > 1, D_(2n)
will do.) [§1.6]

We can take the dihedral group D_(2n), and take the reflection x and the
rotation y (as defined in the previous exercise). Taking g = x and
h = xy, we have that |g| = |x| = 2 (by the first relation),
|h| = |xy| = 2 (by the third relation) and |gh| = |xxy| = |y| = n (by
the second relation).

As for the case with n = 1, we take the group (ℤ₂,  + ) and set
g = h = 1; their sum is the identity 0, which has order 1 (technically,
to stay in the D_(2n) picture, this is isomorphic to the group of
symmtries of a "2-gon", a line, with either the identity, or a flip
across its mediatrix).

2.7)

Find all elements of D_(2n) that commute with every other element. (The
parity of n plays a role.)

A pair of elements commute iff xy = yx. Let a be our test element. We
want a to have the property ∀x ∈ D_(2n), ax = xa. We can write
a = x^(i)y^(j) for 0 ≤ i ≤ 1, 0 ≤ j < n. We have that
ax = x^(i)y^(j)x = x^(i)y^(j − 1)(yx) = x^(i)y^(j − 1)xy^( − 1) = x^(i)y^(j − 2)xy^( − 2) = … = x^(i + 1)y^( − j) = xx^(i)y^( − j) = xa′.
Therefore, only elements such that a′ = x^(i)y^( − j) = x^(i)y^(j) = a
commute, this is equivalent (by cancelling the eventual x on both sides
and aggregating the y’s) to y^(2j) = e, which is true iff j = 0 or
2j = n. Therefore, if n is odd, only the identity commutes with all
elements, and if n is even, both the identity and the rotation of angle
π commute with all elements.

2.8)

Find the orders of the groups of symmetries of the five ’platonic
solids’.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyhedral_group

The five platonic solids are the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron,
the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron. We can find the orders of their
symmetry groups by finding the number of symmetries of each solid.

TetrahedronL The tetrahedron has 4 vertices, 6 edges, and 4 faces (all
equilateral triangles). We can rotate the tetrahedron by 2π/3 about an
axis perpendicular through the center of a face. We can also flip the
tetrahedron across a plane through an edge and the midpoint of its
opposite edge.

Verify carefully that ’congruence mod n’ is an equivalence relation.

We define the relation ∼ as ∀a, b ∈ ℤ, a ∼ b ⇔ ∃k ∈ ℤ, a − b = kn. We
will show that this relation is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.

Reflexivity:

∀a ∈ ℤ, a − a = 0 = 0 ⋅ n ⇒ a ∼ a

Symmetry:

$$\begin{aligned}
\forall a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, a \sim b
&\Leftrightarrow \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, a - b = kn \\
&\Leftrightarrow \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, b - a = -kn \\
&\Leftrightarrow b \sim a
\end{aligned}$$

Transitivity:
$$\begin{aligned}
\forall a, b, c \in \mathbb{Z}, (a \sim b) \land (b \sim c)
&\Leftrightarrow \exists k, l \in \mathbb{Z}, (a - b = kn) \land (b - c = ln) \\
&\Leftrightarrow a - c = (a - b) + (b - c) = (k + l)n \\
&\Leftrightarrow a \sim c
\end{aligned}$$

Therefore, the relation ∼ is an equivalence relation.

Prove that ℤ/nℤ contains precisely n elements.

Each element of ℤ can be written uniquely as m + kn with
m ∈ [[0, n − 1]] and k ∈ ℤ. Therefore, we have n possible values for m.
Because congruence modulo n equates two numbers in ℤ if their difference
is a multiple of n, we have that m and m + kn are equivalent. Therefore,
we can consider an equivalence class associated with m to contain all
elements of the form m + kn. Since we have precisely n such equivalence
classes, ℤ/nℤ contains precisely n elements.

2.11)

Prove that the square of every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 8.
[§VII.5.1]

We write an odd integer as 2n + 1 for n ∈ ℤ. We have that
(2n + 1)² = 4n² + 4n + 1 = 4(n² + n) + 1. We can see that n² + n is
always even, because: if n is even, then n² is even, and n is even, so
their sum is even; and if n is odd, then n² is odd, and n is odd, so
their sum is even. Therefore, we can write n² + n = 2m for some m ∈ ℤ,
and thus (2n + 1)² = 8m + 1, which is congruent to 1 modulo 8.

2.12)

Prove that there are no integers a, b, c such that a² + b² = 3c². (Hint:
by studying the equation [a]₄² + [b]₄² = 3[c]₄² in ℤ/4ℤ, show that
a, b, c would all have to be even. Letting a = 2k, b = 2l, c = 2m, you
would have k² + l² = 3m². What’s wrong with that?)

We can write a² + b² = 3c² as a² + b² = 3c² + 4k with k = 0. Any
solution to the first equation must thus respect the properties of the
second equation. We study these properties by looking at the equation
modulo 4.

$$\begin{aligned}
[a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 = [3]_4 [c]^2_4
&\Leftrightarrow [a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 = [-1]_4 ([c]^2_4) \\
&\Leftrightarrow [a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 + [c]^2_4 = [0]_4 \\
\end{aligned}$$

Since 0 is even, this condition gives us that either two of the numbers
have to be odd, or none of them are. However, looking back at the first
equation, if c is even, then [c]₄² = 0, and [3]₄[c]₄² = 0, which means
that a and b must be both even or both odd. If a and b are both odd
(i.e., either congruent to 1 or  − 1), then [a]₄² = 1 and [b]₄² = 1 and
their sum, supposedly equal to 0, is congruent to 2, which is a
contradiction. In this case, both a and b must be even.

Now if c is odd, then [3]₄[c]₄² = [3]₄[1]₄ = [3]₄ = [ − 1]₄. Since c is
odd, only one of a or b must be odd. Without loss of generality, we
choose that to be b, in which case [b]₄² = 1. Our "the three sum to 0"
equation above then tells us that [a]₄² + [2]₄ = [0]₄, so [a]₄² = [2]₄,
which is a contradiction, because there is no number [a]₄ such that
[a]₄² = [2]₄ (the image of the squaring function is {[0]₄, [1]₄}).
Therefore, c cannot be odd.

We’ve thus shown that the only case not leading to a contradition is the
case where all three numbers are even, and this applies to the original
equation.

Letting a = 2k, b = 2l, c = 2m, you would have k² + l² = 3m², which is
just a rewriting of our initial equation. After iteration this process
until a maximal instance of 2’s has been removed from the prime
factorization of each number, we will eventually reach a point where
either k, l, or (non-exclusive) m is odd, which is a contradiction.
Therefore, there are no integers a, b, c such that a² + b² = 3c².

This exercise is interesting because it teaches us that number theoretic
equations that rely on odd and evenness can effectively be studied using
ℤ/4ℤ.

2.13)

Prove that if gcd (m, n) = 1, then there exist integers a and b such
that am + bn = 1. (Use Corollary 2.5.) Conversely, prove that if
am + bn = 1 for some integers a and b, then gcd (m, n) = 1.

This is known as Bézout’s identity. We remind Corollary 2.5.: The class
[m]_(n) generates ℤ/nℤ if and only if gcd (m, n) = 1. So this exercise
can also be reduced to proving that ∃a, b ∈ ℤ, am + bn = 1 if and only
if [m]_(n) generates ℤ/nℤ.

gcd (m, n) = 1 ⇒ ∃a, b ∈ ℤ, am + bn = 1

We suppose that gcd (m, n) = 1, by Corollary 2.5, we have that [m]_(n)
generates ℤ/nℤ. This means that for every [c]_(n) ∈ ℤ/nℤ, there exists
a ∈ ℤ such that [am]_(n) = [c]_(n). If we take [c]_(n) = [1]_(n), this
means that am = 1 + kn for some k ∈ ℤ. We can rewrite this as
am + bn = 1 for b =  − k.

∃a, b ∈ ℤ, am + bn = 1 ⇒ gcd (m, n) = 1

We suppose that ∃a, b ∈ ℤ, am + bn = 1. We can write this as
am = 1 − bn, which means that m divides 1 − bn. Suppose m and n have a
common prime factor p: this prime factor would divide m and n, and thus
would divide 1 − bn (equivalently its opposite bn − 1) and bn. However,
this is a contradiction, because the only number that can divide two
numbers that are off by 1 is 1. Therefore, m and n have no common prime
factors, and gcd (m, n) = 1.

2.14)

State and prove an analog of Lemma 2.2, showing that the multiplication
on ℤ/nℤ is a well-defined operation.

We remind Lemma 2.2: If a ≡ a′modn andb ≡ b′modn, then
(a + b) ≡ (a′ + b′)modn.

Our analogue is thus: a ≡ a′modn andb ≡ b′modn, then
(a × b) ≡ (a′ × b′)modn.

We now show that it is well-defined (there exists a commutative square
diagram with an epimorphism from ℤ to ℤ/nℤ in one direction, and with
the respective multiplications in the other). We take a ≡ a′modn
andb ≡ b′modn. This means that a − a′ = kn and b − b′ = ln for some
k, l ∈ ℤ. We have that
ab − a′b′ = ab − ab′ + ab′ − a′b′ = a(b − b′) + (a − a′)b′ = a(ln) + (kn)b′ = n(al + kb′).
The first and last terms of this equation give us that ab ≡ a′b′modn, as
needed.

Let n > 0 be an odd integer.

-   Prove that if gcd (m, n) = 1, then gcd (2m + n, 2n) = 1. (Use
    Exercise 2.13.)

-   Prove that if gcd (r, 2n) = 1, then $\gcd(\frac{r+n}{2}, n) = 1$.
    (Ditto.)

-   Conclude that the function [m]_(n) → [2m + n]_(2n) is a bijection
    between (ℤ/nℤ)^(*) and (ℤ/2nℤ)^(*).

The number φ(n) of elements of (ℤ/nℤ)^(*) is Euler’s φ-function. The
reader must proved that if n is odd, then Φ(2n) = Φ(n).

Find the last digit of 1238237¹⁸²³⁸⁴⁵⁶. (Work in ℤ/10ℤ.)

We note that 7² = 49, 7³ = 343, and 7⁴ = 2401, so the order of 7 in
(ℤ/10ℤ,  × )^(*) is 4. Since multiplication is well-defined in ℤ/10ℤ, we
have:

$$\begin{aligned}
[1238237^{18238456}]_{10}
&= [7]_{10}^{18238456} \\
&= [7]_{10}^{4 \cdot 4559614} \\
&= ([7]_{10}^4)^{4559614} \\
&= [7^4]_{10}^{4559614} \\
&= [1]_{10}^{4559614} \\
&= [1]_{10}
\end{aligned}$$

Thus, the last digit of this large number is 1.

2.17)

Show that if m ≡ m′modn, then gcd (m, n) = 1 if and only if
gcd (m′, n) = 1.

We use the result from exercise 2.13:
gcd (m, n) = 1 ⇔ ∃a, b ∈ ℤ, am + bn = 1; similarly,
gcd (m′, n) = 1 ⇔ ∃a′, b′ ∈ ℤ, a′m′ + b′n = 1. We have that m ≡ m′modn,
so m − m′ = kn for some k ∈ ℤ. We can rewrite this as m = m′ + kn. We
can now substitute m in Bézout’s identity:
a(m′ + kn) + bn = 1 ⇒ am′ + akn + bn = 1. We can now let a′ = a + ak and
b′ = b, and we have that gcd (m, n) = 1 ⇔ gcd (m′, n) = 1.

2.18)

For d ≤ n, define an injective function ℤ/dℤ → S_(n) preserving the
operation: that is, such that the sum of equivalence classes in ℤ/nℤ
corresponds to the product of the corresponding permutations.

We can define the function f : ℤ/dℤ → S_(n) as f([a]_(d)) = σ_(a), where
σ_(a) is the permutation that maps i to i + a modulo d (our Caesar
cypher mentioned above, over the d first elements, or any choice of d
elements really).

This function is injective because the permutation σ_(a) is uniquely
determined by a. This can immediately be seen by studying with which
element the first element (which we can label 0) is replaced: it is
replaced with a (the a-th element), leading to d distinct outputs for d
possible inputs. More formally, if a, b ∈ ℤ/dℤ, a ≠ b, then σ_(a) and
σ_(b) are distinct permutations, as they map i to i + a and i + b
respectively, and a ≠ b implies that i + a ≠ i + b for any i.

We can see that the sum of equivalence classes in ℤ/nℤ corresponds to
the product of the corresponding permutations through the following

Both (ℤ/5ℤ)^(*) and (ℤ/12ℤ)^(*) consist of 4 elements. Write their
multiplication tables, and prove that no re-ordering of the elements
will make them match.

For ℤ/5ℤ, we have the elements [1]₅, [2]₅, [3]₅, [4]₅ which are coprime
with 5.

The two groups are not isomorphic, because the first group has elements
of order 4 and the other doesn’t. In fact, the former is isomorphic to
ℤ/4ℤ, and the latter is isomorphic to ℤ/2ℤ × ℤ/2ℤ (the Klein 4-group).

Chapter I) 1) Set notation)

Write the following in set notation (as a list of numbers, and
algebraically):

-   the set of all odd integers

-   the set of all integers that are not multiples of 3

-   the set of integers from 10 (included) to 20 (included)

-   the set of integers from 10 (included) to 20 (excluded)

-   the set of pairs of integers with both elements of the same value

-   the set of triplets of real numbers that together sum to 1

-   the set of pairs of positive real numbers that together sum to 1

-   the set of n-tuplets (for any n) of real number that together sum to
    1

-   the set of all natural numbers such that there exists at least one
    triplet of positive even numbers which are all different and which
    sum to that number.

Now take the sets in their algebraic notation, and represent them both
as a list of numbers (as a logical sequence or just a couple of
examples), and as a "description" of what they are:

-   {3n + 2 | n ∈ ℕ}

-   {3k + 2 | k ∈ ℤ}

-   {2^(i) | i ∈ [[0, 10]]}

-   {(x, y) ∈ ℝ² | x² + y² = 1}

-   {x ∈ ℝ |  − 2 ≤ x ≤ 2}

-   {(m, n, p) ∈ ℕ³ | m + n + p = 10}

Chapter I) 3) Slices and coslices)

Provide a concrete example of a slice category and of a coslice category
based on the category of real vector spaces Vect_(ℝ), or its subcategory
of finite real vector spaces. How does this relate to the transpose of a
matrix, or of a product of matrices ?

Chapter 1, Section 2

On injections and surjections

Injections

Injections (which aren’t also surjections) have multiple left-inverses
(post-inverses). Eg:

A = {a, b}
B = {1, 2, 3}
f : A → B = {(a, 2), (b, 3)}, injective

g₁ : B → A = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b)}
g₂ : B → A = {(1, b), (2, a), (3, b)}

g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f = id_(A)

It is precisely the free element with no antecedent in B (here, 1) which
leaves room for multiple choices, but doesn’t affect the overall
inversion process.

Surjections

Surjections (which aren’t also injections) have multiple right-inverses
(pre-inverses), called sections.

B = {1, 2, 3}
A = {a, b}
f : B → A = {(1, a), (2, a), (3, b)}, surjective

g₁ : A → B = {(a, 1), (b, 3)}
g₂ : A → B = {(a, 2), (b, 3)}

f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ = id_(A)

It is precisely the fact that there are multiple elements that map to
the same element (here, 1 and 2 to a) which leaves room for multiple
choices, but doesn’t affect the overall inversion process.

Cancellations

Function Cancellation Lemma: If a composition of functions cancels out,
then the first of the pair is an injection, and the second of the pair
is a surjection. Algebraically:
$$\forall A, B \in Obj(\textbf{Set}),
f \in (A \to B), g \in (B \to A), \;
    g \circ f = id_A
\Rightarrow
    \begin{cases}
        f \text{ is injective} \\
        g \text{ is surjective}
    \end{cases}$$

Corollary 1: any post-inverse of an injection is a surjection.

Corollary 2: any pre-inverse of a surjection is an injection.

Proof: Let be
A, B ∈ Obj(Set), f ∈ (A → B), g ∈ (B → A), g ∘ f = id_(A)

a) Suppose f is not an injection. This means:
∃x, y ∈ B, x ≠ y and g(x) = g(y)
However, with such an f, we have:
g(x) = g(y) ⇒ f(g(x)) = f(g(y)) = id_(A)(x) = id_(A)(y) = x = y
This means that f is an injection. Contradiction.

Conclusion: in this context, f must be an injection.

b) Suppose g is not a surjection. This means:
∃a ∈ A, a ∉ g(B)
Since g ∘ f = id_(A), that means that g(f(a)) = id_(A)(a) = a, this
means that a ∈ g(B). Contradiction.

Conclusion: in this context, g must be a surjection.

On sections and fibers

Section example with a tangent bundle.

Consider the cylinder S¹ × ℝ, and the function f : S¹ × ℝ → S¹, the
projection onto the circle. The cylinder is itself the space in which
one can easily represent maps of (S¹ → ℝ). Each such map corresponds to
a section.

Let be

$$\begin{aligned}
g_1 : S^1    & \longrightarrow  S^1 \times \mathbb{R} \\
      \theta & \longmapsto      (\theta, 1)
\end{aligned}$$

$$\begin{aligned}
g_2 : S^1    & \longrightarrow  S^1 \times \mathbb{R} \\
      \theta & \longmapsto      (\theta, cos(\theta))
\end{aligned}$$

We have
f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ = id_(S¹)

(TODO add diagrams for S1xR, g1 and g2)

A fiber is the preimage of a singleton. In the case of f above, for
every q ∈ S¹, f^( − 1)(q) is the copy of the real line on the cylinder
that passes by q.

(TODO add diagram)

Alternative characterization of a bijection

"f is bijective" ⇔ ("every element of B has a non-empty fiber"
(surjection) and "every fiber is a singleton" (injection))

On monomorphisms and epimorphisms

Failing the mono/epi condition

Example of failing the monomorphism definition for a non-injection

Monomorphism definition:

$$\text{$f : A \to B$ is a monomorphism}
\\ \Leftrightarrow \\
\forall Z \in \text{Obj}(\mathcal{C}), \;
\forall g_1, g_2 \in \text{Hom}(Z, A), \;
(f \circ g_1 = f \circ g_2 \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2)$$

A = {a, b, c}
B = {1, 2}
Z = {x, y}
f : A → B = {(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 2)}, not injective

g₁ : Z → A = {(x, a), (y, c)}
g₂ : Z → A = {(x, b), (y, c)}

f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ = {(x, 1), (y, 2)} ∈ (Z → B)

The multiple choice of elements (here, a and b) in A which map to 1 in B
is precisely what allows the overall composition to be equal, even when
g₁ ≠ g₂. This provides insight into a proof of "f is a monomorphism
implies that f is an injection". If you suppose that f is a monomorphism
and not an injection, you can easily reach a contradiction, since you
can use elements like 1 and 2 that both map to the same a to construct a
counter-example to the implication that defines a monomorphism.

Example of failing the epimorphism definition for a non-surjection

Epimorphism definition:

$$\text{$f : A \to B$ is an epimorphism}
\\ \Leftrightarrow \\ 
\forall Z \in \text{Obj}(\mathcal{C}), \;
\forall g_1, g_2 \in \text{Hom}(B, Z), \;
(g_1 \circ f = g_2 \circ f \Rightarrow g_1 = g_2)$$

A = {a, b}
B = {1, 2, 3}
Z = {x, y}
f : A → B = {(a, 1), (b, 2)}, not surjective

g₁ : B → Z = {(1, x), (2, y), (3, x)}
g₂ : B → Z = {(1, x), (2, y), (3, y)}

g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f = {(a, x), (b, y)} ∈ (A → Z)

The element 3 in B not being reached by f is precisely that which
provides the opportunity to build g₁ ≠ g₂ such that they compose to the
same result with f, since the output of 3 for them doesn’t affect the
overall composition. This provides insight into a proof of "f is an
epimorphism implies that f is a surjection". If you suppose that f is an
epimorphism and not a surjection, you can easily reach a contradiction,
since you can use elements like 3 that are not reached by f to construct
a counter-example to the implication that defines an epimorphism.

Proofs of mono/inj and epi/surj equivalence

Let f : A → B.

The parts which are "Injection => Monomorphism" and "Surjection =>
Epimorphism" both use the respective sided inverses to prove the
implication.

The other parts use the following tautology to prove the implication by
contradiction. "Suppose that p and ¬q, show that it leads to a
contradiction".

(p ⇒ q) ⇔ ((¬p) ∪ q) ⇔ (¬(p ∩ ¬q))

Injection => Monomorphism

Suppose that f is an injection. It thus has post-inverses.

∃g ∈ (B → A), g ∘ f = id_(A)

From there:

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀a, b ∈ Hom(Z, A),
$$\begin{array}{ccccc} \\
f \circ a = f \circ b & \Rightarrow &  g \circ (f  \circ a) &=&  g \circ (f  \circ b) \\
                      & =           & (g \circ  f) \circ a  &=& (g \circ  f) \circ b  \\
                      & =           &         id_A \circ a  &=&         id_A \circ b  \\
                      & =           &                    a  &=&                    b
\end{array}$$

We conclude that f is also a monomorphism.

Surjection => Epimorphism

Suppose that f is a surjection. It thus has pre-inverses.

∃g ∈ (B → A), f ∘ g = id_(B)

From there:

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀a, b ∈ Hom(B, Z),
$$\begin{array}{ccccc} \\
a \circ f = b \circ f & \Rightarrow & (a \circ  f) \circ g  &=& (b \circ  f) \circ g  \\
                      & =           &  a \circ (f  \circ g) &=&  b \circ (f  \circ g) \\
                      & =           &  a \circ  id_B        &=&  b \circ  id_B        \\
                      & =           &  a                    &=&  b
\end{array}$$

We conclude that f is also an epimorphism.

Monomorphism => Injection

Suppose that f is a monomorphism.

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀g₁, g₂ ∈ Hom(Z, A), f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ ⇒ g₁ = g₂

Suppose now that f is not an injection. Algebraically, this means that:

∃(x, y) ∈ A²,  such that x ≠ y and f(x) = f(y)

We can construct g₁ and g₂ such that f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂ but g₁ ≠ g₂, using
such a pair (x, y). Thereby, we prove that f is not an monomorphism and
arrive at a contradiction.

(If Z is the empty set, being initial in Set, there is only 1 map into A
(the empty map) and a = b always hold. Therefore, any counterexample to
the epimorphism definition needs to have at least 1 element.)

Let Z = {a}.

g₁(a) = x
g₂(a) = y

Clearly, g₁ ≠ g₂. However, we also have:

f(g₁(a)) = f(x) = f(y) = f(g₂(a)) ⇒ f ∘ g₁ = f ∘ g₂

This means that f is not a monomorphism: contradiction.

Conclusion: f is an injection.

Epimorphism => Surjection

Suppose that f is an epimorphism.

∀Z ∈ Obj(𝒞), ∀g₁, g₂ ∈ Hom(B, Z), g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f ⇒ g₁ = g₂

Suppose now that f isn’t a surjection. Algebraically, this means that:

∃x ∈ B, x ∉ f(A)

We can construct g₁ and g₂ such that g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f but g₁ ≠ g₂, using
such an x ∉ f(A). Thereby, we prove that f is not an epimorphism and
arrive at a contradiction.

(If Z is the singleton set, being terminal in Set, there is only 1 map
into Z and a = b always hold. Therefore, any counterexample to the
epimorphism definition needs to have at least 2 elements. We will
however use a 3-element set, since it makes things more intuitive and
pedagogical.)

Let Z = {a, b, c}.

$$g_1 =
\begin{cases}
    \forall x    \in f(A), g_1(x) = a \\
    \forall x \notin f(A), g_1(x) = b
\end{cases}$$

$$g_2 =
\begin{cases}
    \forall x    \in f(A), g_2(x) = a \\
    \forall x \notin f(A), g_2(x) = c
\end{cases}$$

Clearly, g₁ ≠ g₂. However, since A is the domain of f, of g₁ ∘ f, and of
g₂ ∘ f, we have:

g₁ ∘ f = g₂ ∘ f = (x ↦ a) ∈ (A → Z)

This means that f is not an epimorphism: contradiction.

Conclusion: f is a surjection.

Chapter 1, Section 3

Example summary

-   (3.2): Set, category of sets as objects and set functions as
    morphisms.

-   (3.3): preorder (or order, or equivalence relation) over a (single)
    set, transformed into a category; elements of the set as objects,
    and elements of the preorder (which is a relation, hence a subset of
    the cartesian product) as morphisms.

-   (3.4): the powerset with the inclusion operator, transformed into a
    category; elements of the powerset (i.e., subsets of the set) as
    objects, and inclusion relations as morphisms (this is just an
    example of a preorder / order / equivalence category seen in 3.3).

-   (3.5): slice categories 𝒞_(A), categories which isolate a specific
    object A of a given category 𝒞, and studies the morphisms into that
    object; an object of 𝒞_(A) is any morphism from any arbitrary objet
    Z into A (not the homset Hom(Z, A) itself !) and a morphism in 𝒞_(A)
    (from z₁ ∈ Z₁ → A to z₂ ∈ Z₂ → A) is a "raising" σ_(A) into 𝒞_(A) of
    a morphism σ ∈ Z₁ → Z₂ in 𝒞 that preserves composition on morphisms
    in 𝒞 (i.e., z₁ = z₂σ ⇒ σ_(A)z₁ = z₂).

-   (3.6): combining examples 3.3 and 3.5, first start with an order
    category on the set ℤ (there is a morphism m → n iff m ≤ n), then
    select a specific object (here, A = 3) then study all morphisms of
    the category into A (so the relation n ≤ 3 for any Z = n); the
    morphisms σ₃ = (m, 3) → (n, 3) are then simply given by the
    transitivity of ≤, i.e., m ≤ n ≤ 3 ((m, 3) → (n, 3) corresponds to
    m ≤ 3 ⇒ n ≤ 3, meaning our z₁ = z₂σ transforming into σ_(A)z₁ = z₂,
    here, corresponds to (m ≤ 3) = (n ≤ 3) ∩ (m ≤ n) is transformed into
    (m ≤ 3 ⇒ n ≤ 3) ∩ (m ≤ 3) ⇔ (n ≤ 3)).

-   (3.7): coslice categories (morphisms out of a chosen object).

-   (3.8): the category Set^(⋆) of pointed sets, a coslice category over
    Set and any singleton set { ⋆ }. Objects in Set^(⋆) are regular
    sets, but with a unique distinguished element; morphisms are any set
    functions that map the domain’s distinguised element to the
    codomain’s distinguished element.

-   (3.9): "bislice" and "bicoslice" categories, basically a similar
    construct as slice and coslice, but taking two objects of the
    starting category, and studying pairs of morphisms (from a common
    domain, resp codomain) into (resp from) this pair.

-   (3.10): "fibered bislice" and "fibered bicoslice" categories, once
    again a similair construct, but this time taking two morphisms into
    a common set C (resp. from a common set C).

On terminal and initial objects in Set

If $\empty$ is initial and { ⋆ } is terminal, it is because a function
in Set (in categorical terms) must always have an output for every
input. Ie, in category theory, all functions are maps ("applications").

Said algebraically:

$$\forall A, B \in \text{Obj}(\bold{Set}), \;
\forall a \in A, \;
\forall f \in \text{Hom}(A, B), \;
\exists f(a) \in B$$

In the case of $\empty$ as the input set, and there is only one function
$f: \empty \to Z$ for any Z: f is the empty mapping. But any
$Z \to \empty$ (expept $\empty \to \empty$) contains no mapping (since
we’d necessarily be ignoring at least one element of Z).

Similarly, in the case of the (unique up-to-isomorphism) singleton set
{ ⋆ } as the output, you’d have multiple functions (precisely 2^(|Z|))
into it, if you could ignore some elements of the input set. However, if
all elements of the input set are required, that leaves you with only
one function possible from Z → { ⋆ }: the function which maps all
elements to ⋆.

Restrictions and extensions of functions, and its consequences on a function’s nature

8 possibilities to study, based on the following binary dichotomies:

-   injection or surjection

-   enlarging or restricting

-   domain or codomain

Note that enlarging the domain sometimes implies enlarging the codomain,
and restricting the codomain sometimes implies restricting the domain.

Theorems:

A) if f ∈ (A → B), f injective (resp. surjective), then
∀Z ⊆ B, f̂ ∈ ((f^( − 1)(Z) ⊆ A) → Z), f̂ = f|_(f^( − 1)(Z)), the
restriction of the function to the corresponding smaller codomain, is
also an injection (resp. surjection).

B) if f ∈ (A → B), f injective (resp. surjective), then
∀Z ⊇ B, f̂ ∈ (A → Z), f̂ = ι ∘ f (with the ι the canonical injection of
b ∈ B into its superset Z), is also an injection (resp. is never a
surjection).

C) if f ∈ (A → B), f injective, then
∀Z ⊆ A, f̂ ∈ (Z → B), f = ι_((Z → A)) ∘ f̂, we have that f̂ is also an
injection. However, one can construct Z ⊆ A such that f stops being a
surjection.

D) if f ∈ (A → B), f surjective, then
∀Z ⊇ A, f̂ ∈ (Z → (B ∪ f(Z))), f = ι_((Z → A)) ∘ f̂, we have that f̂ is
also a surjection. However, one can construct Z ⊆ A such that f stops
being a injection.

Proof: TODO

On the morphisms of slice and coslice categories

Given a base category 𝒞, and some set A we wish to study the homsets of
the slice (resp. coslice) category 𝒞_(A) (resp. 𝒞^(A). These homsets
might be empty, or have more than one element.

We remind that slice categories consider morphisms to A as their objects
(written as (Z, φ) for any φ : Z → A), while coslice categories consider
morphisms from A as their objects (written as (φ, Z) for any φ : A → Z.
Morphisms, of the form σ_(A) : (Z₁, φ₁) → (Z₂, φ₂) (resp.
σ^(A) : (φ₁, Z₁) → (φ₂, Z₂)) in a slice category 𝒞_(A) (resp. coslice
category 𝒞^(A)) map such objects to one another if and only if there
exists a morphism in 𝒞 (the base category!) such that φ₁ = φ₂σ (resp.
σφ₁ = φ₂).

Example of no σ for a slice category

For example, note that there exist pairs of morphisms f₁ ∈ (Z₁ → A) and
f₂ ∈ (Z₂ → A) between which there is no morphism that exists in the
slice category. One such example we can make is in (Vect_(ℝ))_(ℝ²). If
we take the maps:

$$f_1 = \begin{bmatrix} 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^2)$$
$$f_2 = \begin{bmatrix} 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 \end{bmatrix} \in \mathcal{L}(\mathbb{R}^2)$$

There exists no map σ such that the following diagram commutes (since
the output of f₁ will always be null in its second coordinate, and the
output of f₂ will always be null in the first):

Example of no σ for a coslice category

TODO add potato diagram

Take A = Z₂ = {a, b, c}, φ₂ = id_(A), and Z₁ = {1, 2}. Since
|Z₁| = |dom(σ)| < |cod(σ)| = |Z₂|, there is no possible case in which
Im(σ) = Im(id_(A)) (even if φ₁ is epi).

Example of multiple σ

TODO add potato diagram

Another example, this time in a coslice category, with A = {a, b, c}, we
take $\text{\textbf{Set}}_A$. We take Z₁ = {1, 2, 3}, Z₂ = {T, F}. For
φ₁ : A → Z₁ = {(a, 1), (b, 1), (c, 3)} and
φ₂ : A → Z₂ = {(a, T), (b, T), (c, F)} there exists two elements in
Hom_(𝒮ℯ𝓉^(A))(Z₁, Z₂). These originate from two functions in Set:
σ_(α) = {(1, T), (2, T), (3, F)} and σ_(β) = {(1, T), (2, F), (3, F)}.
The free element in 2 ∈ Z₁ which is not in Im(φ₁) offers a degree of
freedom.

Explanations on the conditions for σ

In the first example, what causes the issue is the fact that the images
of f₁ and f₂ in A are distinct.

In the second example, what causes the issue is the fact that we’ve
reduced our common domain A to an insufficient intermediary object Z₁.

The "element which isn’t mapped to offers a degree of freedom and thus
breaks unicity" in the last example should remind you of the notes on
surjections. Indeed, when comparing σ_(α) and σ_(β), we’re in a context
which is reminiscent of the definition of an epimorphism.

φ₂ = σ_(α)φ₁ = σ_(α)φ₁

We can be assured of being able to cancel φ1 iff φ₁ is an epimorphism,
and thus σ, if it exists, is unique. The proof for slice categories is
similar, but given the reverse orders, uses monomorphisms.

More generally:

-   a) in a slice category, there will be no σ if Im(φ₁) ≠ Im(φ₂) (proof
    ? and in more general categories than concrete categories ? TODO:
    iff ?)

-   b) in a coslice category, there will be no σ if
    Pr(Im(φ₁) ≠ Pr(Im(φ₂)) (proof ? and in more general categories than
    concrete categories ? TODO: iff ?)

-   c) in a slice category, there is at most a single σ iff φ₂ is mono

-   d) in a coslice category, there is at most a single σ iff φ₁ is epi

Notes on counterintuitive rules

-   in some categories (such as ℤ with ≤; or Ring), "mono and epi" does
    not imply "iso"

-   in every abelian category, we have that "iso ⇔ epi and mono" (and
    though Set is not abelian, the property still holds)

-   while in Set, a function is an epimorphism (surjective) iff it has a
    pre-inverse, in Grp, some epimorphisms do not have right inverses.

Chapter 1, Section 5

Initial and terminal objects

-   there are categories without either initial or terminal objects,
    such as the preorder category of ℤ with ≤.

-   there are categories with multiple initial or terminal objects (for
    example, in Set, every singleton set is a terminal object); however,
    these are respectively unique up to isomorphism

-   any object which is both initial and terminal is called a zero
    object.

Universal properties

"Normal" universal properties

Verbatim: "The most natural context in which to introduce universal
properties requires a good familiarity with the language of functors,
which we will only introduce at a later stage. [...] We say that a
construction satisﬁes a universal property (or: ’is the solution to a
universal problem’) when it may be viewed as a terminal object of a
category."

Then: "The declaration/explanation of a universal property generally
follows the pattern ’object X is universal with respect to the following
property: for any Y such that..., there exists a unique morphism Y → X
such that...’; this explanation hides the deﬁnition of an accessory
category, and the statement that X is terminal."

This is a complicated way to say: there is some construct to decompose a
morphism which is "universal" (always exists) and reduces the rest of
the information of the morphism into something "unique" (hence terminal
object of some subcategory).
