<h3 class="unnumbered" id="section-1">Section 1)</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section">1.1)</h4>
<p>In a nutshell, Russell’s paradox proves, by contradiction, that certain mathematical collections cannot be sets. It posits the existence of a "set of all sets that don’t contain themselves". Such a set can neither contain itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that does contain itself", and should be excluded); nor can it exclude it itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that doesn’t contain itself", and should be included).</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-2">1.2)</h4>
<p>Prove that any equivalence relation over a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> defines a partition of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_S\)</span>.</p>
<p>a) <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_S\)</span> has no empty elements: any element in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> is part of at least one equivalence class, the class containing at least that element itself. Since there is no equivalence class constructed independently from elements, there are no empty equivalence classes.</p>
<p>b) Elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_S\)</span> are disjoint: suppose there is an element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> that is part of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, two distinct equivalence classes. <span class="math inline">\(\forall a \in A, x \sim a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\forall b \in B, x \sim b\)</span>. By transivity through <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\forall a \in A, \forall b \in B, a \sim b\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are the same equivalence class: <span class="math inline">\(A = B\)</span>. Contradiction. Therefore all elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_S\)</span> are disjoint subsets of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>.</p>
<p>c) The union of all elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}_S\)</span> makes up <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>: suppose <span class="math inline">\(\exists x \in S\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(x \notin \bigcup_{S_i \in \mathcal{P}_S} S_i\)</span>. From the argument made in (a), <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> exists in at least one equivalence class, the class which contains only <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> itself. This is one of ou <span class="math inline">\(S_i\)</span> sets. Contradiction. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\bigcup_{S_i \in \mathcal{P}_S} S_i = S\)</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-3">1.3)</h4>
<p>Given a partition <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}\)</span> on a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, show how to define a relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is the corresponding partition.</p>
<p>The insight here is to build an equivalence relation such that two elements are equivalent if and only if they are part of the same subset of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, which is understood as their common equivalence class.</p>
<p>We define <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\forall S_i, S_j \in \mathcal{P}, \forall x \in S_i, \forall y \in S_j, x \sim y \Leftrightarrow S_i = S_j\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us prove that <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation.</p>
<p>a) Reflexivity: <span class="math display">\[\forall A \in \mathcal{P}, \forall x \in A, A = A \Rightarrow x \sim x\]</span></p>
<p>b) Symmetry: <span class="math display">\[\forall S_i, S_j \in \mathcal{P}, \forall x \in S_i, \forall y \in S_j, x \sim y \Leftrightarrow S_i = S_j \Leftrightarrow S_j = S_i \Leftrightarrow y \sim x\]</span></p>
<p>c) Transitivity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\forall S_i, S_j, S_k \in \mathcal{P}, \forall x \in S_i, \forall y \in S_j, \forall z \in S_k, \\
(x \sim y) \cap (y \sim z) \\
    \Leftrightarrow \\
(S_i = S_j) \cap (S_j = S_k) \\
    \Rightarrow \\
S_i = S_k \\
    \Leftrightarrow \\
x \sim z
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> is indeed an equivalence relation, and is generated uniquely by the partition.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-4">1.4)</h4>
<p>How many different equivalence relations may be defined on the set <span class="math inline">\(\{1, 2, 3\}\)</span>?</p>
<p>If we start with the 1 element set, we have only one possible partition, one possible equivalence class.</p>
<p>With the 2 element set, there are 2 partitions, <span class="math inline">\(\{\{1, 2\}\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\{\{1\}, \{2\}\}\)</span>.</p>
<p>With the 3 element set, there is:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>1 partition of type 1-1-1: <span class="math inline">\(\{\{1\}, \{2\}, \{3\}\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>3 partitions of type 2-1: <span class="math inline">\(\{\{1\}, \{2, 3\}\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\{\{2\}, \{1, 3\}\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\{\{3\}, \{1, 2\}\}\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>1 partition of type 3: <span class="math inline">\(\{\{1, 2, 3\}\}\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, there are five equivalence classes on the 3 element set.</p>
<p>See the Bell numbers: https://oeis.org/A000110</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-5">1.5)</h4>
<p>Give an example of a relation that is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. What happens if you attempt to use this relation to define a partition on the set?</p>
<p>Let’s imagine a "similarity relation" we can notate with <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span>. We can imagine it to work like a looser version of equality (say for example, if an integer is only <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> away, then it counts as similar).</p>
<ul>
<li><p>reflexive: <span class="math inline">\(\forall a \in S, a \simeq a\)</span> (an element is always "similar" to itself)</p></li>
<li><p>symmetric: <span class="math inline">\(\forall a, b \in S, a \simeq b \Rightarrow b \simeq a\)</span> ("similarity" goes both ways)</p></li>
<li><p>not transitive: <span class="math inline">\(\exists a, b, c \in S, (a \simeq b) \land (b \simeq c) \land \lnot (a \simeq c)\)</span> (just because <span class="math inline">\(a \simeq b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b \simeq c\)</span> are similar, that doesn’t mean <span class="math inline">\(a \simeq c\)</span> works, because it is possible for the "similarity gap" to be too large to qualify as "similar". E.g.: <span class="math inline">\((a, b, c) = (1, 2, 3)\)</span>.).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If we use this to define a partition <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> on some set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(S/\simeq := P_\simeq\)</span>, there is ambiguity as to which element should go into which equivalence class.</p>
<p>This idea deserves further discussion.</p>
<p>In terms of graph theory, if we express a set with an internal relation as a graph, we can represent elements as nodes and relationships as edges. Reflexivity means that every node has a loop (unary, self-edge). Symmetry means that the graph is not directed (since every relationship goes both ways). Transitivity means that every connected subset of nodes is a maximal clique (synonymously, every connected component is a complete subgraph).</p>
<p>In a relation which is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive, you would have connected components of this graph which are not cliques. For these, there is ambiguity as to how you would group their nodes. Two obvious choices would be either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>to remove the minimal number of edges to obtain n distinct cliques (thereby gaining the <em>transitive restriction</em> of the relation) from a given non-clique; or</p></li>
<li><p>to complete the connected subgraph into a clique (thereby gaining the <em>transitive closure</em> of the relation).</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-6">1.6)</h4>
<p>Define a relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> on the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> of real numbers, by setting <span class="math inline">\(a \sim b \Leftrightarrow b - a \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. Prove that this is an equivalence relation, and find a ’compelling’ description for <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}/\sim\)</span>. Do the same for the relation <span class="math inline">\(\approx\)</span> on the plane <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}\)</span> defined by declaring <span class="math inline">\((a_1, a_2) \approx (b_1, b_2) \Leftrightarrow b_1 - a_1 \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } b_2 - a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>
<p>TODO: forgot to prove that it’s an equivalence relation</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(b - a \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> means that 2 real numbers differ by an integral amount. This means that the equivalence relation algebraically describes the idea that "with this relation, 2 real numbers are the same iff they have the same fractional component <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(1 - x\)</span> for negative numbers)". Eg, <span class="math inline">\(4.76 \sim 1024.76 \sim -5.34\)</span>, since <span class="math inline">\(-5.34 + 10 = 4.76\)</span>, etc.</p>
<p>To make an algebraic quotient of a set by an equivalence relation, we take the function which maps each element to its corresponding equivalence class, in the set (partition) containing these equivalence class. Intuitively, this is similar to keeping only one representative element per equivalence class. For the example class above, we can keep the representative <span class="math inline">\(0.76\)</span>. There is such an equivalence class for every fractional part possible, that is, one for every number in <span class="math inline">\([0, 1[\)</span>. The corresponding map is the "real remainder of division modulo 1". This map is well-defined because each real number has only one output for this map, and all real numbers that are equivalent through <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> are mapped to the same value in the output set.</p>
<p>We should also notice that since <span class="math inline">\(0 \sim 1\)</span>, this space loops around on itself. Intuitively, if you increase linearly in the input space <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>, it goes back to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> after <span class="math inline">\(0.9999999...\)</span> in the output space. This output space is thus a circle of perimeter <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(b_1 - a_1 \in \mathbb{Z} \text{ and } b_2 - a_2 \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span> means that 2 points in the 2D plane are the same iff they differ in each coordinate by an integral amount. This boils down to combining two such loops from the first part of the exercise: one in the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> direction and one in the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> direction: what this gives is the small square <span class="math inline">\([0, 1[ \times [0, 1[\)</span>, which loops to <span class="math inline">\(x = 0\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(y = 0\)</span>) when <span class="math inline">\(x = 1\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(y = 1\)</span>) is reached. This space functions like a small torus, of area <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="section-2-1">Section 2)</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-7">2.1)</h4>
<p>How many different bijections are there between a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements and itself?</p>
<p>Any bijection is a choice of a pairs from 2 sets of the same size, where each element is used only once, and each pair has one element from each set. At first there are <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> choices in each set. We go through each possible input element in order (no choice), for each one, we pick one amongst <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possibilities for an output.</p>
<p>There are then <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span> choice of output left, etc.</p>
<p>Ccl°: <span class="math inline">\(\prod_{i=1}^{i=n} i = n!\)</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-8">2.2)</h4>
<p>Prove that a function has a right-inverse (pre-inverse) iff it is surjective (can use AC).</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f \in (A \to B)\)</span>.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="a-rightarrow">2.2.a) <span class="math inline">\(\Rightarrow\)</span></h5>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a right-inverse (pre-inverse). We have <span class="math inline">\(\exists g \in (B \to A), f \circ g = id_B\)</span></p>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is not a surjection. This means <span class="math inline">\(\exists b \in B, \nexists a \in A, b = f(a)\)</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f(g(b))= id_B (b) = b\)</span> Necessarily, <span class="math inline">\(g(b)\)</span> is such an <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(\exists a \in A, b = f(a)\)</span>. Contradiction.</p>
<p>Ccl°:: f is a surjection.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="b-leftarrow">2.2.b) <span class="math inline">\(\Leftarrow\)</span></h5>
<p>Suppose that f is a surjection.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(\forall b \in B, \exists a \in A, b = f(a)\)</span></p>
<p>We will construct a pre-inverse for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<p>The insight here is to realize that a surjection divides its input set into a partition, where each 2-by-2 disjoint subset corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}(\{q\})\)</span>, for every <span class="math inline">\(q\)</span> in the output set. More formally, each "fiber" (preimage of a singleton) is a disjoint subset of the input set, and the union of fibers is the input set itself. You can see this in the following diagram:</p>
<p>(add diagram) 1234 to ab 1a 2a (fiber from a) 3b 4b (fiber from b) https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/157450/producing-a-diagram-showing-relations-between-sets https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/79009/drawing-the-mapping-of-elements-for-sets-in-latex</p>
<p>Using AC, we select a single element from each such fiber. For each <span class="math inline">\(q \in B\)</span>, we name <span class="math inline">\(p_q \in f^{-1}(\{q\})\)</span> the chosen element. We define <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(g \in (B \to A), g = (q \mapsto p_q)\)</span>. With this, <span class="math inline">\(\forall b \in B, f \circ g (b) = b\)</span>, and so <span class="math inline">\(f \circ g = id_A\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> has a preinverse.</p>
<p>A summary of this idea: all surjection preinverses are simply a choice of a representative for each fiber of the surjection as the output to the respective singleton.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-9">2.3)</h4>
<p>Prove that the inverse of a bijection is a bijection, and that the composition of two bijections is a bijection.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="a">2.3.a)</h5>
<p>Using the fact that a function is a bijection iff it has a two-sided inverse (Corollary 2.2) we can see from this defining fact, <span class="math inline">\(f \in (A \to B) \text{ bijective } \Leftrightarrow \exists f^{-1} \in (B \to A), (f^{-1} \circ f = id_A \text { and } f \circ f^{-1} = id_B)\)</span> that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is naturally <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span>’s (unique) two-sided inverse, and so <span class="math inline">\(f^{-1}\)</span> is also a bijection.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="b">2.3.b)</h5>
<p>Let be <span class="math inline">\(f \in (A \to B), g \in (B \to C)\)</span>, both bijective (hence with inverses in the respective function spaces). Let <span class="math inline">\(h \in (A \to C), h = g \circ f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h^{-1} \in (C \to A), h^{-1} = f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}\)</span>. We have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
h^{-1} \circ h &amp;= (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \circ (g \circ f) \\
               &amp;=  f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}  \circ  g \circ f  \\
               &amp;=  f^{-1} \circ          id_B    \circ f  \\
               &amp;=  f^{-1} \circ                        f  \\
               &amp;=  id_A
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
h \circ h^{-1} &amp;= (g \circ f) \circ (f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}) \\
               &amp;=  g \circ f  \circ  f^{-1} \circ g^{-1}  \\
               &amp;=  g \circ     id_B         \circ g^{-1}  \\
               &amp;=  g \circ                        g^{-1}  \\
               &amp;=  id_C
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h^{-1}\)</span> are two-sided inverses of each other, and thus bijections. From this we conclude that the composition of any two bijections is also a bijection.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-10">2.4)</h4>
<p>Prove that ‘isomorphism’ is an equivalence relation (on any set of sets).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="a-problem-statement">2.4.a) Problem statement</h5>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> be a set of sets. We define the relation <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span> between the elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{A}\)</span> as the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\forall X, Y \in \mathcal{A}, \; X \simeq Y \Leftrightarrow \text {there exists a bijection between $X$ and $Y$}\]</span></p>
<p>Let us show that <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span> is an equivalence relation.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="b-reflexivity">2.4.b) Reflexivity</h5>
<p>For any set <span class="math inline">\(A \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>, the identity mapping on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a bijection. This means that <span class="math inline">\(\forall A \in \mathcal{A}, A \simeq A\)</span>, ie, <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span> is reflexive.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="c-symmetry">2.4.c) Symmetry</h5>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
\forall X, Y \in \mathcal{A}, \; X \simeq Y &amp; \Rightarrow \exists f      \in (X \to Y) \text{ bijective} \\
                                            &amp; \Rightarrow \exists f^{-1} \in (Y \to X) \text{ bijective} \\
                                            &amp; \Rightarrow Y \simeq X
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span> is symmetric.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="d-transitivity">2.4.d) Transitivity</h5>
<p>Let be <span class="math inline">\(X, Y, Z \in \mathcal{A}\)</span>. Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(X \simeq Y\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y \simeq Z\)</span>. This means <span class="math inline">\(\exists f \in (X \to Y), g \in (Y \to Z)\)</span>, both bijections. Let be <span class="math inline">\(h \in (X \to Z), h = g \circ f\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is also a bijection since the composition of two bijections is also a bijection (exercise 2.3).</p>
<p>The existence of <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> implies <span class="math inline">\(X \simeq Z\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span> is transitive.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="e-conclusion">2.4.e) Conclusion</h5>
<p>Isomorphism, <span class="math inline">\(\simeq\)</span>, is a relation on an arbitrary set (of sets) which is always reflexive, symmetric and transitive. It is thus an equivalence relation.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-11">2.5)</h4>
<p>Formulate a notion of epimorphism and prove that epimorphisms and surjections are equivalent.</p>
<p>See "notes" file: section "Proofs of mono/inj and epi/surj equivalence".</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-12">2.6)</h4>
<p>With notation as in Example 2.4, explain how any function <span class="math inline">\(f \in (A \to B)\)</span> determines a section of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span>.</p>
<p>A section is the preinverse of a surjection. Here, the surjection in question is <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span> the projection of <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> onto <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f \in (A \to B)\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now consider the function which maps an input <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> to its "geometric representation" (its coordinates in the enclosing space <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span>, corresponding to a point of the graph <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_f\)</span>). <span class="math display">\[\hat{f} \in (A \to (A \times B)), \hat{f} = ( \; a \mapsto (a, f(a)) \; )\]</span> We notice that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}(A) = \Gamma_f\)</span>.</p>
<p>Naturally, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A \circ \hat{f} = (a \mapsto a) = id_A\)</span>, therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> is a pre-inverse (section) of <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span>.</p>
<p>This set of relationships can be expressed in the following commutative diagram:</p>
<p>PS: see "On sections and fibers" in the "notes" file for a worked example.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-13">2.7)</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f \in (A \to B)\)</span> be any function. Prove that the graph <span class="math inline">\(\Gamma_f\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Using the elements from the previous exercise, we know that <span class="math inline">\(\hat{f}\)</span> is injective from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span>. This property is inherited to any restriction of the codomain <span class="math inline">\(Z \subseteq A \times B\)</span>, and corresponding implied restriction of the domain to <span class="math inline">\(Y = \hat{f}^{-1}(Z) \subseteq A\)</span>. In particular, here, <span class="math inline">\(Y = A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Z = \Gamma_f = \hat{f}(A)\)</span>. We now consider <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f} \in (A \to \Gamma_f), \overline{f} = (a \mapsto \hat{f}(a))\)</span>. We can see that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is injective from being a restriction of an injective function to a smaller codomain. We also know that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is surjective, since its domain is its image. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f}\)</span> is a bijection. This means that <span class="math inline">\(A \simeq \Gamma_f\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-14">2.8)</h4>
<p>Describe as explicitly as you can all terms in the canonical decomposition of the function <span class="math inline">\(f \in (\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C})\)</span> defined by <span class="math inline">\(f = (r \mapsto e^{2 \pi i r})\)</span>. (This exercise matches one assigned previously, which one?)</p>
<p>Firstly, elements of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> are equivalent by this map (they have the same output) if they vary by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> from each other. This is a reference to the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> in exercise 1.6. Therefore, we will use <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}/\sim \; \simeq S^1\)</span> in our decomposition. Obviously, the map from <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}/\sim)\)</span>, which maps each element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span> to respective their equivalence class is a surjection (since there’s no empty equivalence class).</p>
<p>Secondly, as mentioned, we have a bijection <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f}\)</span> between <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}/\sim\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span>, the circle group of unit complex numbers, namely <span class="math inline">\(\tilde{f} = (x \mapsto e^{2 \pi i x}\)</span>, where each element <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}/\sim\)</span> can be understood to correspond to a (class representative) value in the interval <span class="math inline">\([0, 1[\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, we do the canonical injection of <span class="math inline">\(S^1\)</span> into its superset <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-15">2.9)</h4>
<p>Show that if <span class="math inline">\(A \simeq A&#39;\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \simeq B&#39;\)</span> , and further <span class="math inline">\(A \cap B = \emptyset\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A&#39; \cap B&#39; = \emptyset\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B \simeq A&#39; \cup B&#39;\)</span>. Conclude that the operation <span class="math inline">\(A \coprod B\)</span> (as described in §1.4) is well-defined up to isomorphism.</p>
<p>We suppose the aforementioned.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span> be a bijection from <span class="math inline">\(A \to A&#39;\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span> be a bijection from <span class="math inline">\(B \to B&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>We define the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f \in (A \cup B \to A&#39; \cup B&#39;),
\text{ such that }
\begin{cases}
    \forall a \in A, \; f(a) = f_A(a) \\
    \forall b \in B, \; f(b) = f_B(b)
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>This function is a well-defined function, since <span class="math inline">\(A \cap B = \emptyset\)</span>: every element of the domain has one, and only one, possible image.</p>
<p>Similarly, we define:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[g \in (A&#39; \cup B&#39; \to A \cup B),
\text{ such that }
\begin{cases}
    \forall a \in A&#39;, \; g(a) = f_A^{-1}(a) \\
    \forall b \in B&#39;, \; g(b) = f_B^{-1}(b)
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>Similarly, because <span class="math inline">\(A&#39; \cap B&#39; = \emptyset\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is well-defined.</p>
<p>Let us study <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f\)</span>. We have: <span class="math display">\[\begin{cases}
    \forall a \in A, \; g(f(a)) = f_A^{-1}(f_A(a)) = a \\
    \forall b \in B, \; g(f(b)) = f_B^{-1}(f_B(b)) = b
\end{cases}\]</span></p>
<p>Hence, <span class="math inline">\(g \circ f = id_{A \cup B}\)</span>. Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(f \circ g = id_{A&#39; \cup B&#39;}\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(g = f^{-1}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is a bijection, and <span class="math inline">\(A \cup B \simeq A&#39; \cup B&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>We’ll now do a shift in notation. Let be some arbitrary sets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Let be <span class="math inline">\(A_1, A_2, B_1, B_2\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(A_1 = \{ 1 \} \times A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A_2 = \{ 2 \} \times A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B_1 = \{ 1 \} \times B\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B_2 = \{ 2 \} \times B\)</span>. This means <span class="math inline">\(A \simeq A_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(A \simeq A_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B \simeq B_1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(B \simeq B_2\)</span>. It also means <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \cap A_2 = \emptyset\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B_1 \cap B_2 = \emptyset\)</span>. From the above, this implies <span class="math inline">\(A_1 \cup B_1 \simeq A_2 \cup B_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This means that the disjoint union of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is indeed well-defined, up to isomorphism: so long as 2 respective copies of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are made in a way that their intersection is empty, the 2 respective unions of 1 copy each will be isomorphic.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-16">2.10)</h4>
<p>Show that if <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> are finite sets, then <span class="math inline">\(|B^A| = |B|^{|A|}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The number of <span class="math inline">\(|B^A|\)</span> functions in <span class="math inline">\(B^A = (A \to B)\)</span> can be counted in the following way.</p>
<p>For each element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, of which there are <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span>, we can pick any element of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> as the image; a total of <span class="math inline">\(|B|\)</span> choices per choice of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. This means <span class="math inline">\(|B| \times ... \times |B|\)</span>, a total of <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span> times. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(|B^A| = |B|^{|A|}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-17">2.11)</h4>
<p>In view of Exercise 2.10, it is not unreasonable to use <span class="math inline">\(2^A\)</span> to denote the set of functions from an arbitrary set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to a set with <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> elements (say <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{B} = \{0, 1\}\)</span>). Prove that there is a bijection between <span class="math inline">\(2^A\)</span> and the power set <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Simply put, every subset <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is built through a series of <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span> choices: for each element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, do we keep the element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> in our subset <span class="math inline">\(A_i\)</span> (output <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>) or do we remove it (output <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>) ? It is then easy to see that such a series of choices can easily be encoded as a unique function in <span class="math inline">\(A \to \mathbb{B}\)</span>. The totality of such series of choices thus corresponds both to the space <span class="math inline">\(A \to \mathbb{B}\)</span>, and to the powerset <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(A)\)</span>, and there is a bijection between the two.</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="section-3-1">Section 3)</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-18">3.1)</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a category. Consider a structure <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> with:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(Obj(\mathcal{C}^{op}) \coloneqq Obj(\mathcal{C})\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>for <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> (hence, objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>), <span class="math inline">\(Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (A, B) \coloneqq Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, A)\)</span></p></li>
</ul>
<p>Show how to make this into a category.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="a-composition">3.1.a) Composition</h5>
<p>First, to make things clearer and more rigorous, let us distinguish composition in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> and composition in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span>. We define <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span> as: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp; \forall f \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B), \\
    &amp; \forall g \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, B) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, C), \\
    &amp; \exists h \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, C), \\
    &amp; f \star g \coloneqq g \circ f = h
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>We will now show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span> verifies the other axioms of a category (namely identity and associativity of composition).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="b-identity">3.1.b) Identity</h5>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is a category, since <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> has the same objects, and since, by definition, for all object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (A, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, A)\)</span>, we can take every <span class="math inline">\(id_A \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}}(A, A)\)</span> as the same identity in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span>. We can verify that this is compatible with <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \forall A, B &amp; \in Obj (\mathcal{C})        &amp;=&amp; \;  Obj (\mathcal{C}^{op})        , \\
    \exists id_A &amp; \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, A) &amp;=&amp; \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (A, A) , \\
    \exists id_B &amp; \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, B) &amp;=&amp; \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, B) , \\
    \forall f    &amp; \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B) &amp;=&amp; \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) , \\
    f            &amp; =   f    \circ id_A          &amp;=&amp; \;  id_A \star f                  , \\
    f            &amp; =   id_B \circ    f          &amp;=&amp; \;  f    \star id_B                 \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="c-associativity">3.1.c) Associativity</h5>
<p>Using associativity in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    \forall A, B, C, D &amp; \in Obj (\mathcal{C})        &amp;=&amp; \;  Obj (\mathcal{C}^{op})        , \\
    \forall f          &amp; \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B) &amp;=&amp; \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) , \\
    \forall g          &amp; \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (B, C) &amp;=&amp; \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (C, B) , \\
    \forall h          &amp; \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (C, D) &amp;=&amp; \;  Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (D, C) , \\
\end{aligned}\]</span> <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    h \star (g \star f) &amp;=&amp;  h \star (f  \circ g) \\
                        &amp;=&amp; (f \circ  g) \circ h  \\
                        &amp;=&amp;  f \circ (g  \circ h) \\
                        &amp;=&amp; (g \circ  h) \star f  \\
                        &amp;=&amp; (h \star  g) \star f  \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span> is associative.</p>
<p>We conclude that <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> is a category.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-19">3.2)</h4>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is a finite set, how large is <span class="math inline">\(End_{\text{Set}}(A)\)</span> ?</p>
<p>We know that, in Set, <span class="math inline">\(End_{\text{Set}}(A) = (A \to A) = A^A\)</span>. From a previous exercise, we know that <span class="math inline">\(|B^A| = |B|^{|A|}\)</span>, therefore <span class="math inline">\(|End_{\text{Set}}(A)| = |A|^{|A|}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-20">3.3)</h4>
<p>Formulate precisely what it means to say that "<span class="math inline">\(1_a\)</span> is an identity with respect to composition" in Example 3.3, and prove this assertion.</p>
<p>Example 3.3 is that of a category over a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> with a (reflexive, transitive) relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>, where the objects of the category are the elements of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>, and the homset between two elements <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> is the singleton <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(a \sim b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> otherwise. Composition <span class="math inline">\(\circ\)</span> is given by transitivity of <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\((b,c) \circ (a,b) = (a,c)\)</span>. Reflexivity gives the identities (<span class="math inline">\(id_a = (a,a)\)</span> for any element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>).</p>
<p>In this context, to say that "<span class="math inline">\(1_a\)</span> is an identity with respect to composition" means that we can cancel out an element of the form <span class="math inline">\((a,a)\)</span> from a composition.</p>
<p>Formally, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\forall a,b \in S, (b,b) \circ (a,b) = (a,b) = (a,b) \circ (a,a)\]</span></p>
<p>proving that <span class="math inline">\((b,b)\)</span> is indeed a post-identity, and <span class="math inline">\((a,a)\)</span> a pre-identity, in this context.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-21">3.4)</h4>
<p>Can we define a category in the style of Example 3.3, using the relation <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> on the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> ?</p>
<p>(Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)</p>
<p>Naively, saying like in example 3.3 "there is a singleton homset <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(a,b)\)</span> each time we have <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span>", we cannot define such a category, since <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span> is not reflexive, and we would thus lack identity morphisms.</p>
<p>However, in a roundabout way, we can define a category over the <em>negation</em> of <span class="math inline">\(&lt;\)</span>: "there is a singleton homset <span class="math inline">\(\text{Hom}(a,b)\)</span> each time we DO NOT have <span class="math inline">\(a &lt; b\)</span>". Namely this corresponds to the relation <span class="math inline">\(\ge\)</span>, which is, itself, reflexive, transitive (and antisymmetric), and is a valid instance of the kind of category presented in example 3.3.</p>
<p>In fact, the pair <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}, \geq)\)</span> is an instance of what is called a "totally ordered set", which is a more restrictive kind of "partially ordered set" (also called "poset" for short). Consequently, this kind of category is called a "poset category".</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-22">3.5)</h4>
<p>Explain in what sense Example 3.4 is an instance of the categories considered in Example 3.3.</p>
<p>(Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)</p>
<p>Example 3.4 describes a category <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S}\)</span> where the objects are the subsets of a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> (equivalently: elements of the powerset <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span>), and morphisms between two subsets <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> are singleton (or empty) homsets based on whether the inclusion is true (or false).</p>
<p>Inclusion of sets, <span class="math inline">\(\subset\)</span>, is also an order relation, this time between the elements of a set of sets (here, <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{P}(S)\)</span>). This means inclusion is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. This makes <span class="math inline">\(\hat{S}\)</span> a poset category, and thus another instance of example 3.3.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-23">3.6)</h4>
<p>Define a category <span class="math inline">\(V\)</span> by taking <span class="math inline">\(Obj(V) = \mathbb{N}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(Hom_V(n, m) = Mat_\mathbb{R}(m, n)\)</span>, the set of <span class="math inline">\(m \times n\)</span> matrices with real entries, for all <span class="math inline">\(n, m \in \mathbb{N}\)</span>. (I will leave the reader the task to make sense of a matrix with 0 rows or columns.) Use product of matrices to define composition. Does this category ’feel’ familiar ?</p>
<p>The formulation of the exercise is strange. It says to use the product of matrices to define composition, and to have homsets be sets of matrices, but objects of the category are supposed to be integers. I don’t know of any matrix with real entries that maps an integer to an integer in this way.</p>
<p>We thus infer that the meaning of the exercise can be one of two things.</p>
<p>Either we suppose the set of objects could rather be understood as "something isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>", ie, the collection of real vector spaces with finite bases (ie, <span class="math inline">\(\forall n \in \mathbb{N}, \mathbb{R}^n\)</span>). In which case, this is just the category of real vector spaces with finite basis (and linear maps as morphisms), which is a subcategory of the category real vector spaces (commonly called <span class="math inline">\(Vect_{\mathbb{R}}\)</span>). In this context, any morphism starting from <span class="math inline">\(0 \simeq \mathbb{R}^0 = \{0\}\)</span> is just the injection of the origin into the codomain; and any morphism ending at <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> is the mapping of all elements to the origin.</p>
<p>Otherwise, we understand this as "yes, the objects of the category are integers: this means you should ignore the actual content of the matrices, and instead consider only their effect on the dimensionality of domains and codomains". In this case, this category is a complete directed graph over <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span> where each edge corresponds to the change in dimension (from domain to codomain) caused by a given linear map.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-24">3.7)</h4>
<p>Define carefully objects and morphisms in Example 3.7, and draw the diagram corresponding to composition.</p>
<p>Example 3.7 (on coslice categories) refers to example 3.5 (on slice categories). Let’s go over slice categories (since example 3.5 asks the reader to "check all [their various properties]").</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="slice-categories">3.7.1) Slice categories</h5>
<p>Slice categories are categories made by singling out an object (say <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>) in some parent (larger) category (say <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>), and studying all morphisms into that object. These morphisms become the objects of a new category (ie, for any <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f \in (Z \to A)\)</span> is an object of the slice category, called <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span> in this context). In the slice category, morphisms are defined as those morphism in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> that preserve composition between 2 morphisms into <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Note that there exist pairs of morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f_1 \in (Z_1 \to A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2 \in (Z_2 \to A)\)</span> between which there is no morphism that exists in the slice category. One such example we can make is in <span class="math inline">\((Vect_\mathbb{R})_{\mathbb{R}^2}\)</span> (see notes "On the morphisms of slice and coslice categories" for more details).</p>
<p>3.7.1.a) Identity</p>
<p>A generic identity morphism is expressed diagrammatically in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span> as:</p>
<p>We can see that since <span class="math inline">\(f = f \circ id_Z\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, this is compatible with the definition of a (pre-/right-)unit morphism in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span>. Also, since the only maps post-<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> are maps from <span class="math inline">\(A \to A\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(id_A\)</span> as the (post-/left-)unit for every morphism <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (ie, <span class="math inline">\(f = id_A \circ f\)</span>.</p>
<p>3.7.1.b) Composition</p>
<p>Taking 3 objects of the slice category (<span class="math inline">\(f_1 \in (Z_1 \to A)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2 \in (Z_2 \to A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_3 \in (Z_3 \to A)\)</span>), and two morphisms (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> via a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-morphism <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \in (Z_1 \to Z_2)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau_A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> via a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-morphism <span class="math inline">\(\tau \in (Z_2 \to Z_3)\)</span>), we have that <span class="math inline">\(f_1 = f_2 \circ \sigma\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2 = f_3 \circ \tau\)</span>. This is expressed as the following commutative diagram.</p>
<p>Composition of morphisms is then defined as <span class="math inline">\(\tau_A \circ_A \sigma_A\)</span> as a mapping from <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(f_1 = f_3 \circ (\tau \circ \sigma)\)</span>. This can be understood through the following commutative diagram:</p>
<p>Which commutes, because we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f_1 &amp;=&amp;  f_2              \circ \sigma  \\
        &amp;=&amp; (f_3 \circ  \tau) \circ \sigma  \\
        &amp;=&amp;  f_3 \circ (\tau  \circ \sigma)
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Thus, we have a working composition of morphisms.</p>
<p>3.7.1.c) Associativity</p>
<p>We take 4 objects of the slice category (<span class="math inline">\(f_1 \in (Z_1 \to A)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2 \in (Z_2 \to A)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_3 \in (Z_3 \to A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_4 \in (Z_4 \to A)\)</span>), and three morphisms (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma_A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\tau_A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\upsilon_A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_4\)</span>). Using composition defined as above, we have</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
f_1 &amp;=&amp; f_4 \circ ( \upsilon \circ (\tau  \circ \sigma)) \\

<p>A coslice category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^A\)</span> is similar, except it takes the morphisms coming <em>from</em> a chosen object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, rather than those going <em>to</em> this object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. Below is a commutative diagram in the style of the one of the textbook for slice categories.</p>
<p>We can similarly show that this also defines a category.</p>
<p><span class="underline">3.7.2.a) Identity</span></p>
<p>A generic identity morphism is expressed diagrammatically in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^A\)</span> as:</p>
<p>We can see that since <span class="math inline">\(f = id_Z \circ f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, this is compatible with the definition of a (post-/left-)unit morphism in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^A\)</span>. Also, since the only maps pre-<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> are maps from <span class="math inline">\(A \to A\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(id_A\)</span> as the (pre-/right-)unit for every morphism <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> (ie, <span class="math inline">\(f = f \circ id_A\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="underline">3.7.2.b) Composition</span></p>
<p>Taking 3 objects of the slice category (<span class="math inline">\(f_1 \in (A \to Z_1)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_2 \in (A \to Z_2)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_3 \in (A \to Z_3)\)</span>), and two morphisms (<span class="math inline">\(\sigma^A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> via a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-morphism <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \in (Z_1 \to Z_2)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\tau^A\)</span> mapping <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span> via a <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>-morphism <span class="math inline">\(\tau \in (Z_2 \to Z_3)\)</span>), we have that <span class="math inline">\(f_1 = \sigma \circ f_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_2 = \tau  \circ f_3\)</span>. This is expressed as the following commutative diagram.</p>
<p>Composition of morphisms is then defined as <span class="math inline">\(\tau^A \circ^A \sigma^A\)</span> as a mapping from <span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(f_3\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(f_3 = (\tau \circ \sigma) \circ f_1\)</span>. This can be understood through the following commutative diagram:</p>
<p>Which commutes, because we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    f_3 &amp;=&amp;  \tau \circ                f_2  \\

<p>Thus, we have a working composition of morphisms.</p>

<p>A subcategory <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C&#39;}\)</span> of a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> consists of a collection of objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, with morphisms <span class="math inline">\(Hom_\mathcal{C&#39;} (A, B) \subseteq Hom_\mathcal{C} (A, B)\)</span> for all objects <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(Obj(\mathcal{C&#39;})\)</span>, such that identities and compositions in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> make <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C&#39;}\)</span> into a category. A subcategory <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C&#39;}\)</span> is <em>full</em> if <span class="math inline">\(Hom_\mathcal{C&#39;} (A, B) = Hom_\mathcal{C} (A, B)\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(Obj(\mathcal{C&#39;})\)</span>. Construct a category of <em>infinite sets</em> and explain how it may be viewed as a full subcategory of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span>.</p>
<p>To put it less technically, a "subcategory" <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C&#39;}\)</span> is just "picking only certain items of a base category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and making sure that things stay closed uneder morphism composition". It is "full" if <em>all</em> morphisms between the objects that remain are also conserved.</p>
<p>We can construct a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{InfSet}\)</span> of infinite sets by taking all the objects <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\nexists n \in \mathbb{N}, |A| = n\)</span>, and only homsets between these objects. This is clearly a subcategory of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span>, since it inherits all identity morphisms, composition works the same, and so does associativity; also, restricting the choice of homsets makes it so that the category is closed (you can’t reach a finite set via a homset that went from an infinite to a finite set).</p>
<p>For this category to not be full, there would need to be some homset that loses a morphism, or fully disappears, in the ordeal. However, there is no restriction as to the kind of morphism that is conserved, so any homset that is kept is identical to its original version. Finally, homsets between infinite sets are also infinite sets, so they don’t disappear in this operation.</p>
<p>Consequently <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{InfSet}\)</span> defined as such is a full subcategory of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-26">3.9)</h4>
<p>An alternative to the notion of multiset introduced in §2.2 is obtained by considering sets endowed with equivalence relations; equivalent elements are taken to be multiple instances of elements ’of the same kind’. Define a notion of morphism between such enhanced sets, obtaining a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{MSet}\)</span> containing (a ’copy’ of) <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> as a full subcategory. (There may be more than one reasonable way to do this! This is intentionally an open-ended exercise.) Which objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{MSet}\)</span> determine ordinary multisets as defined in §2.2, and how? Spell out what a morphism of multisets would be from this point of view. (There are several natural notions of morphisms of multisets. Try to define morphisms in MSet so that the notion you obtain for ordinary multisets captures your intuitive understanding of these objects.) [§2.2, §3.2, 4.5]</p>
<p>Let us recall how multisets were defined in §2.2. Since duplicate elements do not exist in sets, multisets were instead defined as functions from a set <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}*\)</span>, the set of (nonzero) positive integers. This allows each element in <span class="math inline">\(S\)</span> to have a "count", thereby encoding the intuitive notion of multiset. A similar, and equivalent (isomorphic), way of defining it is <em>via</em> pairs <span class="math inline">\((s, n) \in S \times \mathbb{N}*\)</span>, which is simpler to think about. We’ll call this category <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{CMSet}\)</span>, for "count multiset" (TODO: probably has a conventional and better name, but I don’t know it). As for morphisms in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{CMSet}\)</span>, we can consider that for any multisets <span class="math inline">\(A = S_A \times \mathbb{N}*\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B = S_B \times \mathbb{N}*\)</span>, the homset from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is simply the set functions from <span class="math inline">\(S_A \times \mathbb{N}*\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(S_B \times \mathbb{N}*\)</span> as usual.</p>
<p>We first notice that if we restrict <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{CMSet}\)</span> to only the objects for which all elements have a count of <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and where morphisms only ever output to <span class="math inline">\(\{ 1 \}\)</span> in the second coordinate (a subcategory we can call <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{C1MSet}\)</span>, for example), we get a "copy" of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{C1MSet}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> are isomorphic in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Cat}\)</span>. This is a full subcategory because there are no morphisms that map counts to anything else than <span class="math inline">\(\{ 1 \}\)</span> if we restrict our objects to this form; so all morphisms between the kept objects are also kept.</p>
<p>Now let us do a similar construction, but based on equivalence classes instead. We know that each equivalence class over a set corresponds uniquely to a partition of that set. By considering only these partitions (these "sets of sets") as objects, we can build a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{EMSet}\)</span> (for "equivalence multiset"). The "count" corresponds simply to the cardinal of a top-level element in the partition. For example, the top-level elements of <span class="math inline">\(M = \{ S_1, S_2, S_3 \}= \{ \{a\}, \{b, c\}, \{d, e, f\} \}\)</span> would be understood to have counts <span class="math inline">\(|S_1| = 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|S_2| = 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|S_3| = 3\)</span> respectively.</p>
<p>As for morphisms in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{EMSet}\)</span>, they simply map each top-level element of the domain multiset (a distinct subset of the original set) to some other top-level elements in the codomain multiset. This has precisely the same effect as mapping pairs of "value and count" as seen in the previous <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{CMSet}\)</span> construction.</p>
<p>In this example, any set itself, when "injected" (by a functor) into <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{EMSet}\)</span> would just nest all of its elements into singletons. I.e., <span class="math inline">\(S = \{ a, b, c \}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> would become <span class="math inline">\(S = \{ \{a\}, \{b\}, \{c\} \}\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{EMSet}\)</span>. This also shows how restricting <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{EMSet}\)</span> to "only objects that are a set of (toplevel) singletons" makes <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{EMSet}\)</span> have a "copy" of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> as a full subcategory (for similar arguments as above).</p>
<p>Yet another example could be something akin to polynomials with integer coefficients on freeform indeterminates of degree 1 (which would be our set elements); raising the operators one rank, a product of freeform variables with integer powers (multiplicities), etc.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-27">3.10)</h4>
<p>Since the objects of a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> are not (necessarily) sets, it is not clear how to make sense of a notion of ’subobject’ in general. In some situations it does make sense to talk about subobjects, and the subobjects of any given object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> are in one-to-one correspondence with the morphisms <span class="math inline">\(A \to \Omega\)</span> for a fixed, special object <span class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, called a subobject classifier. Show that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span> has a subobject classifier.</p>
<p>We define the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{B} = \{ 0, 1 \}\)</span>, aka the binary alphabet or booleans, as the subobject classifier of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{Set}\)</span>. For any subset <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, there is a unique map <span class="math inline">\(f: B \to \mathbb{B}\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(\forall b \in B, f(b) = 1 \Leftrightarrow b \in A\)</span> (otherwise <span class="math inline">\(f(b) = 0\)</span>, of course, as the equivalence and lack of alternatives to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> as an output imply). The map <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> always fully describes <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> from its relationship with <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>.</p>

<p><span class="underline">3.11.4.c) Identity</span></p>
<p>Once again, it is clear that identity morphisms exist for all objects, simply by taking <span class="math inline">\(Z = Z_1 = Z_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_1 = f_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_1 = g_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = id_Z\)</span>, in the diagram above.</p>
<p><span class="underline">3.11.4.d) Composition</span></p>
<p>Let be 3 objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{\alpha, \beta}\)</span>, which we will name <span class="math inline">\(p_1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_3\)</span> (and define with the respective <span class="math inline">\((Z_n, f_n, g_n)\)</span> triplet for <span class="math inline">\(p_n\)</span>).</p>
<p>Composition <span class="math inline">\(\tau^{\alpha, \beta} \circ \sigma^{\alpha, \beta} = p_1 \mapsto p_3\)</span> of two morphisms <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{\alpha, \beta} = p_1 \mapsto p_2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\tau^{\alpha, \beta} = p_2 \mapsto p_3\)</span> is defined so that the following diagram commutes.</p>
<p><span class="underline">3.11.4.e) Associativity</span></p>
<p>Associativity follows from associativity of morphisms in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, similarly to what was done for slice categories in exercise 3.7 .</p>
<h3 class="unnumbered" id="section-4-1">Section 4)</h3>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-29">4.1)</h4>
<p>Composition is defined for <em>two</em> morphisms. If more than 2 morphisms are given, one may compose them in several ways, so that every step only consists in composing 2 morphisms. Prove that for any such valid sequence of morphisms, the order of parentheses doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>This boils down to showing that associativity is a global property, that doesn’t just make parentheses meaningless when there are 3 elements and 2 operators between them, but in general <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements with <span class="math inline">\((n-1)\)</span> operators between them.</p>
<p>Note: A useful way of visualizing this is representing the order of operations as a binary tree, and noticing that applying associativity (forwards or backwards) is just a tree rotation (resp. right or left) at a given node. Then it is easy to show that one can always obtain a "left comb binary tree". Since every choice of parentheses is equal to this left comb choice, and equality is transitive, every choice of parentheses is equal to every other choice.</p>
<p>To be more rigorous, we will proceed by induction.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Hypothesis:</span> <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> = "for a given <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(f_n f_{n-1} \cdot f_1\)</span> any valid, composable, ordered sequence of morphisms in our base category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, any choice <span class="math inline">\(H\)</span> of parentheses to compose elements of this sequence 2-by-2, giving a formula <span class="math inline">\(s_H\)</span>, will lead to the same result, which can be seen by always having <span class="math inline">\(s_H = (\cdot(f_n f_{n-1}) \cdot) f_1\)</span>".</p>
<p><span class="underline">Initialization:</span> We initialize at <span class="math inline">\(n = 3\)</span>; the validity is immediate as it is precisely the definition of associativity.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Heredity:</span> We suppose the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> true for a given <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 3\)</span>; let us show that this implies that the hypothesis is true for <span class="math inline">\(P(n+1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>What this means is that, no matter the composable ordered sequence <span class="math inline">\(f_n f_{n-1} \cdot f_1\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> functions, for a fixed <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, the order of parentheses does not matter. Note that though <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is chosen and fixed; the statement is true for EVERY (ordered, composable) sequence of functions. We add a new function <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> to this sequence. By a simple renaming of the functions, we deduce that it doesn’t matter where we insert <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, so we’ll insert it at the very right to simplify our argument, giving us the sequence <span class="math inline">\(f_n f_{n-1} \cdot f_1 g\)</span>.</p>
<p>Here, there are 3 cases. Either:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is part of the last composition (i.e., it’s not in a semantically necessary parenthethical grouping; it can be made external to all parentheses),</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is part of the first composition (i.e., the first operation is <span class="math inline">\((f_1 g)\)</span>)</p></li>
<li><p>it isn’t either (it’s inside some non-removable parentheses, and needs to be composed earlier on, but not as the first operation).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is part of the last composition, then by applying the hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> to the terms <span class="math inline">\(f_n f_{n-1} \cdot f_1\)</span>, we immediately find that our new sequence can be made equal to <span class="math inline">\(((\cdot(f_n f_{n-1}) \cdot) f_1) g\)</span>, which is precisely what we wanted for <span class="math inline">\(P(n+1)\)</span>.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is part of the first composition, we isolate it so that it isn’t anymore. To do so, we apply "backwards" associativity on the grouping of terms <span class="math inline">\(F_k (f_1 g)\)</span> in order to obtain <span class="math inline">\((F_k f_1) g\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(F_k\)</span> is the appropriate choice of <span class="math inline">\((f_k \cdot f_2)\)</span> such that associativity can be applied (with <span class="math inline">\(2 \leq k \leq n\)</span>). This makes it so that our problem is identical to our final case, solved just below.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is part of neither the first nor last composition, then we consider the innermost composition <span class="math inline">\((f_k f_{k-1})\)</span> to be a single element <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>. We now have a sequence of only <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> terms. We apply our hypothesis <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span>. This makes <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> the outermost right term, part of the last composition. Unravelling <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> back into two members, we see that we are back at our initial case, with an arbitrary order of parentheses for the <span class="math inline">\(f_n f_{n-1} \cdot f_1\)</span> terms, and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> outermost. We already saw that this implied <span class="math inline">\(P(n+1)\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="underline">Conclusion:</span> since we have initialization and heredity of our hypothesis in all cases, we can conclude by induction that it is true for all <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 3\)</span>.</p>

<p>In Example 3.3 we have seen how to construct a category from a set endowed with a relation, provided the latter is reflexive and transitive. For what types of relations is the corresponding category a groupoid (cf. Example 4.6) ?</p>
<p>We remind example 4.6 : a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. This means that every morphism needs to be 2-way invertible.</p>
<p>In this context, this means that for every morphism <span class="math inline">\(a \sim b\)</span>, there should be a corresponding inverse morphism <span class="math inline">\(b \sim a\)</span>. This property is precisely the symmetry of a relation.</p>

<p>As was mentioned in the text, "order" categories (poset categories) where there’s only at most one morphism between any two objects makes it so that every morphism is trivially an epimorphism (i.e., since there is at most one morphism "<span class="math inline">\(\leq\)</span>" between any two elements, so you always have <span class="math inline">\(\beta&#39; = \beta&quot; = \leq\)</span>, and since <span class="math inline">\(\beta&#39; = \beta&quot;\)</span> is always true, anything implication with it as a necessary condition is also true, and therefore every morphism is true). However, only identities have any kind of inverse (since they are isomorphisms, they are their own inverse); other combinations of elements go one-way, because of antisymmetry.</p>

<p>Prove that the composition of two monomorphisms is a monomorphism.

<p>Give a concrete description of monomorphisms and epimorphisms in the category <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{MSet}\)</span> you constructed in Exercise 3.9. (Your answer will depend on the notion of morphism you defined in that exercise!)</p>
<p>We’ll use our <span class="math inline">\(\mathbf{CMSet}\)</span> construction, where elements of multisets consisted of a pair of the set-element and its count in the multiset.</p>
<p>We recall that in the way we formulated this, morphisms were just simple set functions on "(element, count)" pairs (i.e., returning any other "(element, count)" pair of the codomain).

<p>Prove that a final object in a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> is initial in the opposite category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span></p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a category. Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> be the dual category on <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be a final object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.

We will call this morphism <span class="math inline">\(f_Z\)</span> (respectively).</p>
<p>We remind how we defined composition in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}^{op}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\star\)</span>, respecting: <span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
    &amp; \forall f \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}^{op}} (B, A) = Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, B), \\

<p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> is the <em>unique</em> initial object in <strong>Set</strong>.</p>
<p>First we will prove that it is initial, then that it is unique.</p>
<p>Initiality: we take an arbitrary set <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> in <strong>Set</strong>. We wish to study <span class="math inline">\(Hom_{\text{\textbf{Set}}}(\emptyset, Z) = Z^\emptyset\)</span>. We recall that functions (in category theory) are defined as "applications" / "mappings" are in traditional set theory (i.e., as a relation between sets where every antecedent in the domain has a singleton image in the codomain; the key point being that "no input has no result when passed through the function"). Let <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> be an initial element in <strong>Set</strong>. We write <span class="math inline">\(|I| = n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|Z| = m\)</span>. We know that <span class="math inline">\(|Z^I| = |Z|^{|I|} = m^n\)</span>. For <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> to be initial, this is true if and only if <span class="math inline">\(m^n = 1\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, and so if and only if <span class="math inline">\(n = 0\)</span>. We recall that the empty set is the only set with <span class="math inline">\(|\emptyset| = 0\)</span>, therefore <span class="math inline">\(I = \emptyset\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now this is already enough to prove unicity, but let us spell it out for pedagogy’s sake.</p>
<p>Unicity: We recall that two objects of <strong>Set</strong> are isomorphic if, and only if, there exists a bijection between them. This is equivalent to saying that two sets have the same cardinal. We once again recall that the empty set is the only set with <span class="math inline">\(|\emptyset| = 0\)</span>; there are no bijections relating to the empty set, other than its identity, the unique morphism in <span class="math inline">\(Hom_{\text{\textbf{Set}}}(\emptyset, \emptyset)\)</span> . Using proposition 5.4 (that terminal objects are unique up-to-isomorphism), we finally deduce that <span class="math inline">\(\emptyset\)</span> is the unique initial object in <strong>Set</strong>.</p>
<p>NB: the unique function in <span class="math inline">\(Z^\emptyset\)</span> is always the empty function.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-36">5.3)</h4>
<p>Prove that final objects are unique up to isomorphism.</p>
<p>Let us suppose we have a category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> with two final objects, <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span>.</p>
<p>For every object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> there is at least one element in <span class="math inline">\(Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, A)\)</span>, namely the identity <span class="math inline">\(1_A\)</span>. If <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is final, then there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(F \to F\)</span>, which therefore must be the identity <span class="math inline">\(1_F\)</span>.</p>
<p>We assumed that <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> are both final in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> is final, there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : F_2 \to F_1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span> is final, there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(g : F_1 \to F_2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. Consider <span class="math inline">\(fg : F_1 \to F_1\)</span> ; as observed, necessarily the composite <span class="math inline">\(fg = 1_{F_1}\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> is final. By the same token <span class="math inline">\(gf = 1_{F_2}\)</span>. Thus <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> are inverses of each other, proving <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is an isomorphism. Since there exists an isomorphism between <span class="math inline">\(F_1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(F_2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(F_1 \simeq F_2\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-37">5.4)</h4>
<p>What are initial and final objects in the category of "pointed sets" (Example 3.8)? Are they unique?</p>
<p>We recall that a pointed set is just a regular set with a special, identified point, and that the category of pointed sets <strong>Set*</strong> is built upon the same objects as <strong>Set</strong>, but where each object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in <strong>Set</strong> is multiplied into <span class="math inline">\(|A|\)</span> copies of itself in <strong>Set*</strong> (one for each choice of special point; this implies that the empty set is not a part of <strong>Set*</strong>, since it has no point). Morphisms in <strong>Set*</strong> are set functions, but with the restriction of mapping the special point in the domain to the special point in the codomain.</p>
<p>Given this information, we will prove that the initial and final objects in <strong>Set*</strong> are the singleton sets.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((O, o)\)</span> be a singleton set in <strong>Set*</strong>. Let <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span> be the single element of <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span>; it is necessarily also the special point, as there is no other choice. For any codomain <span class="math inline">\((Z, z_0)\)</span> in <strong>Set*</strong>, the condition that "special points map to special points" restricts our choice of function to the unique function <span class="math inline">\({(o, z_0)}\)</span>, thus, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is initial. If <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> had more than one element, there would exist some <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> (non-singletons) for which the other element would allow another degree of freedom (and thus <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> would not be initial).</p>
<p>Similarly, now studying <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> as a domain and <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> as a codomain, we see that that only function from <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is (like in <strong>Set</strong>) the function which maps everything (including <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>’s special point) to <span class="math inline">\(o\)</span>. Thus, <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> is final. If <span class="math inline">\(O\)</span> had more than one element, there would similarly be many choices for any <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> of cardinal <span class="math inline">\(\geq 2\)</span>, so long as the special point maps to the special point.</p>
<p>Every singleton pointed set is both initial and final in <strong>Set*</strong> and is thus a zero object. These are also the only such pointed sets.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-38">5.5)</h4>
<p>What are the final objects in the category considered in §5.3?</p>
<p>The category considered in paragraph 5.3 is the coslice category over some set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, written <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span>. However, what is presented in this paragraph is some extra structure that arises when considering the statement "The quotient <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim\)</span> is universal with respect to the property of mapping <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to a set in such a way that equivalent elements have the same image". We thus give some equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> on <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and study the quotient set <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim\)</span> in the general coslice category; to do this, we consider the subcategory <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span> where only <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> such that "equivalence is preserved" (i.e., such that <span class="math inline">\(\forall a&#39;, a&#39;&#39; \in A, a&#39; \sim a&#39;&#39; \Rightarrow \varphi(a&#39;) = \varphi(a&#39;&#39;)\)</span>).</p>
<p>With:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> the canonical surjection of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> onto its quotient <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim\)</span>,</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_2\)</span>) being some arbitrary function from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to some arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(Z_1\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(Z_2\)</span>),</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> any function (if it exists) such that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \varphi_1 = \varphi_2\)</span></p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f_1\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(f_2\)</span>) is the (unique!) function such that <span class="math inline">\(s f_1 = \varphi_1\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(s f_2 = \varphi_2\)</span>)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram commutes, and summarizes the situation.</p>
<p>Objects in this category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span> (and <em>a fortiori</em> <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span>) are denoted as <span class="math inline">\((\varphi, Z)\)</span> and are obtained from what used to be <em>morphisms</em> (regular functions) in <strong>Set</strong>. Morphisms are mappings <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\mathcal{Q}} : (\varphi_1, Z_1) \to (\varphi_2, Z_2)\)</span> such that one exists if and only if <span class="math inline">\(\exists \sigma \in (Z_1 \to Z_2), \sigma \varphi_1 = \varphi_2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\forall a&#39;, a&#39;&#39; \in A, a&#39; \sim a&#39;&#39; \Rightarrow \varphi(a&#39;) = \varphi(a&#39;&#39;)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the textbook also asks whether such a category has initial objects, we will first also answer this and consider all terminal objects.</p>
<p>The initial object of a general coslice category is <span class="math inline">\((id_A, A)\)</span>. This is easily verified by doing <span class="math inline">\(\varphi_1 = id_A\)</span>, necessarily <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \varphi_1 = \sigma id_A = \sigma = \varphi_2\)</span>, in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. This implies that, for the domain <span class="math inline">\((id_A, A)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span> and any codomain <span class="math inline">\((\phi_2, Z_2)\)</span>, there always exists a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_A \in Hom_{C_A}((id_A, A), (\phi_2, Z_2))\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span>, corresponding to the (existing and unique) <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = \phi_2\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. We also see that this object satisfies the "equivalence preservation" condition, hence it exists in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span>, and is also the initial object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span>.</p>
<p>The below are this description first in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, followed by the description in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span>.</p>
<p>Now in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span>.</p>
<p>A general coslice category has a final object <span class="math inline">\((t, F)\)</span> (or many final objects <span class="math inline">\((t_i, F_i)\)</span>) iff <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> has a final object <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (or many final objects <span class="math inline">\(F_i\)</span>). In that case, any final object <span class="math inline">\((t, F)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span> corresponds to the unique morphism from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> (for any final <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>) in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. Let us verify this.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> be final in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span> be the unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(t \in Hom_{\mathcal{C}} (A, F)\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\((\varphi, Z)\)</span> be an arbitrary object of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_A\)</span>. Let be <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma \varphi = t\)</span>. We consider the following diagram:</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is final in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is unique and always exists. Also, since <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is unique and always exist, the choice of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> is irrelevant: this same <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> works for all choices of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span> for a given arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>. This proves that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_{\mathcal{C}_A}\)</span> exists and is unique for all <span class="math inline">\((\varphi, Z)\)</span>. Finally, since <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> works for all choices of <span class="math inline">\(\varphi\)</span>, it works for those that satisfy the "equivalence preservation" condition, and so does <span class="math inline">\(t\)</span>: this means that <span class="math inline">\((t, F)\)</span> is indeed a final object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{Q}\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-39">5.6)</h4>
<p>Consider the category corresponding to endowing (as in Example 3.3) the set <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}^+\)</span> of positive integers with the divisibility relation. Thus there is exactly one morphism <span class="math inline">\(d \to m\)</span> in this category if and only if <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> without remainder; there is no morphism between <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> otherwise. Show that this category has products and coproducts. What are their ’conventional’ names? [§VII.5.1]</p>
<p>Like example 3.3, this is a case of "category made from an order relation over a set", since divisibility is an order relation (reflexive, antisymmetric, transitive).</p>
<p>Let us remind the definition of categorical products and coproducts. We consider some general category <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>An object <span class="math inline">\(A \prod B\)</span> is the product of two objects <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> iff there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(\pi_B\)</span>) from <span class="math inline">\(A \prod B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>), and for every <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and for every pair of morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f_A : Z \to A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_B : Z \to B\)</span>, there exists a single morphism <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = f_A \prod f_B\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A \sigma = f_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_B \sigma = f_B\)</span>. This is summarized in the following commutative diagram.</p>
<p>An object <span class="math inline">\(A \coprod B\)</span> is the coproduct of two objects <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> iff there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(i_A\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(i_B\)</span>) from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> (resp. <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) into <span class="math inline">\(A \coprod B\)</span>, and for every <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and for every pair of morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f_A : A \to Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_B : B \to Z\)</span>, there exists a single <span class="math inline">\(\sigma = f_A \coprod f_B)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma i_A = f_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma i_B = f_B\)</span>. This is summarized in the following commutative diagram.</p>
<p>We now return to our "divisibility order category". We write its objects as simple integers, and the (if it exists, unique) morphism representing "divisibility of <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> by <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>" as <span class="math inline">\((n | m)\)</span>. The conventional name of the product for this category is "greatest common divisor" (or "meet"), and of the coproduct, "least common multiple" (or "join").</p>
<p>The following commutative diagrams represent this fact. Take two arbitrary naturals <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Any number <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> which divides both <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> also divides their GCD. Likewise, if <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a multiple of both <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, then it is a multiple of their LCM.</p>

<p>TODO, fix, since <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A&#39;,B&#39;}\)</span> need to both be treated.</p>
<p>This is what we are give by the prompt:</p>

<p>We define <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}\)</span> as the "bicoslice category of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> over <strong>Set</strong>". Objects in this category are pairs of morphisms <span class="math inline">\((f,g)\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, respectively, into sets <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>.

<p>Morphisms are defined between objects as</p>

<p>Let us call <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> the following object of <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(A \coprod B\)</span> is any choice of valid disjoint union of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>:</p>
<p>By definition of a coproduct, we know that in such a configuration, a morphism <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{A,B}\)</span> from this object into any other object of <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}\)</span> exists and is unique, and so is the <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> on which it is based. This means that <span class="math inline">\(I\)</span> is initial in <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}^{A,B}\)</span>.</p>
<p>TODO fix and explain</p>
<p>We observe that <span class="math inline">\(i_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(i_{A&#39;}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i_{B&#39;}\)</span> are all injections, and thus are post-cancellable, by maps <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{A&#39;}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_{B&#39;}\)</span> (which are surjections).</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(f_{A&#39;} = i_{A&#39;} \circ f_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f_{B&#39;} = i_{B&#39;} \circ f_B\)</span> together define a unique map <span class="math inline">\(f_{AB}\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(A \coprod B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A&#39; \coprod B&#39;\)</span>.</p>
<p>We set arbitrary <span class="math inline">\(g_A : A&#39; \to Z\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B : B&#39; \to Z\)</span>; we have <span class="math inline">\(g_A \circ f

These define a unique map from <span class="math inline">\(A \coprod B\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, which we’ll write <span class="math inline">\(g_{AB} \circ f_{AB}\)</span>.</p>

(Hint: observe that they both satisfy the universal property for the product of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, then use Proposition 5.4.)</p>
<p>Let us first remind the definition of the product of two sets. It is the set made of all pairs of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> (ordered sequences of two elements, where the first element in the sequence comes from <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and the second comes from <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>) It is the structure such that the following diagram commutes, and <span class="math inline">\((f,g)\)</span> is unique.</p>
<p>Now to extend the diagram to consider both <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \times A\)</span>.</p>
<p>We seek to prove that given such a commutative diagram (with a unique <span class="math inline">\((f,g)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((g,f)\)</span>), which we will call <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, then we have <span class="math inline">\(A \times B \simeq B \times A\)</span>.</p>
<p>We define <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A,B}\)</span> as the "bislice category of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>". Objects in this category are pairs of morphisms <span class="math inline">\((f,g)\)</span> from sets <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, into <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>, respectively.

<p>Using the diagram <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> defined above, and the definition of a product (ie, that the maps from any <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> to it in the appropriate configuration are unique). We deduce that both <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B \times A\)</span> are final objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A,B}\)</span>. Finally, using Proposition 5.4, i.e., that final objects in a category are unique up-to-isomorphism, we conclude that <span class="math inline">\(A \times B \simeq B \times A\)</span>.</p>

<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> be a category with products. Find a reasonable candidate for the universal property that the product <span class="math inline">\(A \times B \times C\)</span> of three objects of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> ought to satisfy, and prove that both <span class="math inline">\((A \times B) \times C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A \times (B \times C)\)</span> satisfy this universal property. Deduce that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B) \times C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A \times (B \times C)\)</span> are necessarily isomorphic.</p>
<p>Given 3 objects <span class="math inline">\(A, B, C\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>. We propose the following universal property that <span class="math inline">\(A \times B \times C\)</span> should respect: for all objects <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and triplet of maps <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> respectively, there exists a unique triplet-map <span class="math inline">\((f,g,h)\)</span> is unique such that the following diagram commutes.</p>

<p>We now consider the <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A, B, C}\)</span> as the "trislice category of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>". Objects in this category are of the form:</p>
<p>Morphisms are defined between objects as:</p>
<p>such that there exists a <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> making the following diagram commute in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>:</p>
<p>We now define the following object:</p>
<p>and using the two universal properties we have shown above, we know that necessarily <span class="math inline">\((A \times B) \times C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A \times (B \times C)\)</span> are terminal objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A,B,C}\)</span>. This is because they are final objects in respective bislice categories, given that <span class="math inline">\(((f,g),h)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((f,(g,h))\)</span> are both unique; and we can compose <span class="math inline">\(p_A \circ p_{A \times B}\)</span>, etc, to get immediate projections, making them final in the trislice category as well. To be precise:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(((A \times B) \times C), \; p_A \circ p_{A \times B}, \; p_B \circ p_{A \times B}, \; p_C)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[((A \times (B \times C)), \; \pi_A, \; \pi_B \circ \pi_{B \times C}, \; \pi_C \circ \pi_{B \times C})\]</span></p>
<p>are both final objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A,B,C}\)</span>, as is shown by the following commutative diagram, which is composed from the diagrams above:</p>
<p>We use Proposition 5.4 to deduce that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B) \times C\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(A \times (B \times C)\)</span>, as terminal objects in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A,B,C}\)</span>, are necessarily isomorphic. Therefore, given this "associativity up-to-isomorphism" of a triple product, it is legitimate to call <span class="math inline">\(A \times B \times C\)</span> (with no parentheses) "the" (unique, up-to-isomorphism) final object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{A,B,C}\)</span>.</p>

<li><p>Use the universal property for quotients (§5.3) to establish that there are functions <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; A/\sim_A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; B/\sim_B\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>prove that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/\sim\)</span>, with these two functions, satisfies the universal property for the product of <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B/\sim_B\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p>conclude (without further work) that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/ \sim \; \simeq (A / \sim_A) \times (B / \sim_B)\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="a-5">5.11.a)</h5>
<p>First, we remind the universal property for quotients. Given an equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> over a set <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, there is a single map <span class="math inline">\(\pi : A \to A/\sim\)</span> such that, for any map <span class="math inline">\(f : A \to Z\)</span> verifying <span class="math inline">\(f(a_1) = f(a_2)\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\(a_1 \sim a_2\)</span> (i.e., the morphism <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is "well-defined" for the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>), there exists a unique map <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f} : A/\sim \to Z\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(f = \overline{f} \circ \pi\)</span>. This is summarized in the following commutative diagram:</p>
<p>We now apply the universal property of products to obtain the following commutative diagram:</p>
<p>We then consider a well-defined map <span class="math inline">\(f : (A \times B) \to Z\)</span> (i.e., <span class="math inline">\(f(a_1, b_1) = f(a_2, b_2)\)</span> whenever <span class="math inline">\((a_1, b_1) \sim (a_2, b_2)\)</span>). We apply the universal property of quotients to the relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> defined over <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span>. We define the map <span class="math inline">\(\pi : A \times B \to (A \times B)/\sim\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\pi(a,b) = [(a,b)]_\sim\)</span>. We define the map <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f} : (A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; Z\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f}([(a,b)]_\sim) = f(a,b)\)</span>. We remind that such an <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is unique, and that <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f} \circ \pi = f\)</span>.</p>
<p>We do a similar construction for <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim_A\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B/\sim_B\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span>. We can do so since these maps are also well-defined. Indeed, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{l}
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
        (a_1, b_1) \sim (a_2, b_2) \\
        (a_1, b_1) \sim (a_2, b_2) \Rightarrow f(a_1, b_1) = f(a_2, b_2) \\
        f = f_A \circ p_A \\
        f = f_B \circ p_B
    \end{array}
    \right.
\cr \Rightarrow \\
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
        a_1 \sim_A a_2 \text{ and } b_1 \sim_B b_2 \\
        f_A(p_A(a_1, b_1)) = f_A(p_A(a_2, b_2)) \\
        f_B(p_B(a_1, b_1)) = f_B(p_B(a_2, b_2)) 
    \end{array}
    \right.
\cr \Rightarrow \\
    \left\{
    \begin{array}{l}
        f_A(a_1) = f_A(a_2) \\
        f_B(b_1) = f_B(b_2) 
    \end{array}
    \right.
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>The combination of all previous steps gives us the following commutative diagram.</p>
<p>Let us recap a little what’s in diagram a little, to show that it is a justified construction:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> is a product, and so we may obtain <span class="math inline">\(p_A\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(p_B\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is well-defined for the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span>, and so we may obtain <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f_A\)</span> is well-defined for the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim_A\)</span>, and so we may obtain <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f_A}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span> is well-defined for the equivalence relation <span class="math inline">\(\sim_B\)</span>, and so we may obtain <span class="math inline">\(\overline{f_B}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_B\)</span>;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Therefore, we have the maps <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_A = \pi_A \circ p_A \in (A \times B) \to A/\sim_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_B = \pi_B \circ p_B \in (A \times B) \to B/\sim_B\)</span>. <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_B\)</span> are well-defined because they are compositions of well-defined maps. For <span class="math inline">\(\pi_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\pi_B\)</span>, we know that the projector and unique function part (of the universal property of quotients) are necessarily well-defined, otherwise they wouldn’t compose to a well-defined map. As for <span class="math inline">\(p_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_B\)</span>, they are well-defined because they are projections, and projections are always well-defined.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_B\)</span> are well-defined, we can "quotient through" (i.e., use the universal property of quotient for) <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/\sim\)</span>.</p>
<p>This gives us the following commutative diagram (compatible with the one above, but it’s too messy to represent both at the same time):</p>
<p>These are precisely our functions <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\Pi_A} \in (A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; A/\sim_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\overline{\Pi_B} \in (A \times B)/\sim \; \to \; B/\sim_B\)</span>, and they are unique, as per the universal property of quotients.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="b-5">5.11.b)</h5>
<p>What we wish to prove now is that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/\sim\)</span> is the product of <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B/\sim_B\)</span>. Said otherwise, we wish to show that, for all <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B\)</span> in the appropriate configuration, the following diagram commutes:</p>
<p>Using the fact that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)\)</span> is already a product, and studying maps <span class="math inline">\(h_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_B\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(Z\)</span> into <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> respectively, we can make the following commutative diagram:</p>
<p>The internal parts of the diagram (except <span class="math inline">\(h_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_B\)</span> which are arbitrary, all other arrows are unique morphisms) force <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B\)</span> to commute with the rest of the diagram: any pairs of maps <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B\)</span> that make the diagram commute must necessarily be constrained by the existing morphisms (as the composition of unique morphisms). Any choice of maps <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B\)</span> must respect <span class="math inline">\(g_A = \pi_A \circ h_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B = \pi_B \circ h_B\)</span>, for corresponding arbitrary (but inferred) <span class="math inline">\(h_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h_B\)</span>; said otherwise, maps <span class="math inline">\(g_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_B\)</span> in this configuration can only exist if they make the diagram commute. Therefore, we have shown that <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/\sim\)</span> satisfies the universal property of the product of <span class="math inline">\(A/\sim_A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B/\sim_B\)</span>, and we have <span class="math inline">\((g_A, g_B) = \pi \circ (h_A, h_B)\)</span> (though it’s not shown on the above diagram, in order to improve legibility).</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="c-2">5.11.c)</h5>
<p>We know that elements that verify a common universal property are terminal objects (of the same kind) in some comma category. Here, both <span class="math inline">\((A \times B)/ \sim\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(((A / \sim_A) \times (B / \sim_B))\)</span> are final objects in the bislice category <span class="math inline">\(\text{\textbf{Set}}_{A,B}\)</span>. Since they are both final objects in the same category, they are isomorphic.</p>
<p>Conclusion: <span class="math inline">\(((A \times B)/ \sim) \; \simeq \; ((A / \sim_A) \times (B / \sim_B))\)</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-45">5.12)</h4>
<p>Define notions of fibered products and coproducts, as terminal objects of the categories <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(C^{\alpha,\beta}\)</span> considered in Example 3.10 (cf. also Exercise 3.11), by stating carefully the corresponding universal properties. As it happens, <strong>Set</strong> has both fibered products and coproducts. Define these objects ’concretely’, in terms of naive set theory. [II.3.9, III.6.10, III.6.11]</p>

<p>This means, for any generic object <span class="math inline">\((Z, f, g)\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>, we have the following diagram:</p>

<p>We will now show that this object <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> induces a terminal object in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>; this boils down to showing that <span class="math inline">\((P, p_A, p_B)\)</span> is final in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\((Z, f, g)\)</span> be an arbitrary object of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>. A morphism <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\((Z, f, g)\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\((P, p_A, p_B)\)</span> is a "raising" of a morphism <span class="math inline">\(h : Z \to P\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(p_A \circ h = f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(p_B \circ h = g\)</span>. This raising <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is unique if and only if <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> is unique. Since <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> is presupposed to verify the universal property, such an <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span>, if it exists, is indeed unique. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\((P, p_A, p_B)\)</span> is final (<em>a fortiori</em> terminal) in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}_{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>.</p>
<h5 class="unnumbered" id="b-6">5.12.b)</h5>
<p>We now define the fibered coproduct (or "pushout"). We suggest the reader goes to check section 3.11.4 of this exercises solutions document for a refresher on the "fibered bicoslice category" <span class="math inline">\(C^{\alpha,\beta}\)</span>.

<h5 class="unnumbered" id="c-3">5.12.c)</h5>
<p>(I wouldn’t have come up with this without Wikipedia as a hint...)</p>
<p>In <strong>Set</strong>, the fibered product (pullback) of <span class="math inline">\((A, \alpha)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((B, \beta)\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, is a special subset of the cartesian product <span class="math inline">\(A \times B\)</span> that registers some extra information, pertaining to the functions <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. We write this object as <span class="math display">\[P = A \times_{\alpha, C, \beta} B = A \times_C B = \{ (a,b) \in A \times B \mid \alpha(a) = \beta(b) \}\]</span>.</p>
<p>Concretely, this can also be expressed as <span class="math display">\[P = \bigcup_{c \in \alpha(A) \cap \beta(B)} \alpha^{-1}[\{c\}] \times \beta^{-1}[\{c\}]\]</span>. This is the set of all pairs (of inputs) <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(a) = \beta(b)\)</span>. Let us show this is the case with a simple example.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A = \{1,2,3\}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B = \{w, x, y, z\}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C = \{l, m, n, p\}\)</span>. We define <span class="math inline">\(\alpha : A \to C\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{(1, m), (2, m), (3, n) \}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta : B \to C\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{ (w, l), (x, m), (y, n), (z, n) \}\)</span>. We have <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(A) = \{m,n\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta(B) = \{l, m, n\}\)</span>, therefore <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(A) \cap \beta(B) = \{m,n\}\)</span>. The fibered product is then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lll}

<p>A simple way to verify this is to verify that for each pair <span class="math inline">\((a,b)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(a) = \beta(b)\)</span>, and that no such other pairs are missing.</p>

<p>https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2240882/understanding-an-example-of-a-pushout-in-mathbfset</p>
<p>In <strong>Set</strong>, the fibered coproduct (pushout) of <span class="math inline">\((\alpha, A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((\beta, B)\)</span> over <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is a special quotient of the disjoint union <span class="math inline">\(A \sqcup B\)</span> that registers some extra information, pertaining to the functions <span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>. We write this object as <span class="math display">\[P = A \sqcup_{\alpha, C, \beta} B = A \sqcup_C B = (A \sqcup B) / \sim\]</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sim\)</span> is an equivalence relation defined as <span class="math inline">\(\sim \; := cl_{eq}(R)\)</span>, the equivalence closure of the relation <span class="math display">\[R = \{((0, a), (1, b)) \in (A \sqcup B) \times (A \sqcup B) \mid \exists c \in C, a = \alpha(c) \text{ and } b = \beta(c) \}\]</span> (i.e., two elements are equivalent if they are both the output of some common <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>, or if there is any chain of such equivalences between them).</p>
<p>(We remind that the equivalence closure, if elements of the set are seen as vertices and the relation pairs as edges of a graph, can be thought of, visually, as "completing the cliques" of each connected component in the graph, including self-loops; hence the idea that if there is any path between two elements, then they are equivalent and should be directly linked. We also remind that this corresponds uniquely to a partition of the set; the elements of which, called cosets, are what allow us to do an algebraic quotient.)</p>
<p>The fibered coproduct is the set <span class="math inline">\(P\)</span> obtained by taking the disjoint union <span class="math inline">\(A \sqcup B\)</span> and identifying <span class="math inline">\(a \in A\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(b \in B\)</span> if there exists <span class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(c) = a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta(c) = b\)</span> (and all identifications that follow to keep the equality relation an equivalence relation). There is no more concrete of a definition than this; it really boils down to identifying elements with a common preimage element through <span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1}(A)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}(B)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, via an equivalence relation.</p>
<p>Let us show this is the case with a simple example. We will keep the elements of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> distinct in order to remove the visual clutter that comes with the <span class="math inline">\((0, ...)\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\((1, ...)\)</span> of the general disjoint union.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(A = \{ 1, 2, 3 \}\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(B = \{ w, x, y, z \}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(C = \{ l, m, n \}\)</span>. We define <span class="math inline">\(\alpha : C \to A\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{ (l, 1), (m, 1), (n, 2) \}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\beta : C \to B\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(\{ (l, x), (m, y), (n, z) \}\)</span>. We have:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1}(\{1\}) = \{l,m\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}(\{x\}) = \{l\}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(1 \sim x\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1}(\{1\}) = \{l,m\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}(\{y\}) = \{m\}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(1 \sim y\)</span>, and by closure, <span class="math inline">\(1 \sim x \sim y\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1}(\{2\}) = \{n\}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}(\{z\}) = \{n\}\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(2 \sim z\)</span>;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\alpha^{-1}(\{3\}) = \emptyset\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta^{-1}(\{w\}) = \emptyset\)</span>, so you might think that <span class="math inline">\(3 \sim w\)</span>, however, since there is no <span class="math inline">\(c \in C\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\alpha(c) = 3\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\beta(c) = w\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(3 \nsim w\)</span>;</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This information corresponds to the following partition of <span class="math inline">\(A \sqcup B\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\(\{ \{1,x,y\}, \{2,z\}, \{3\}, \{w\} \}\)</span>. The fibered coproduct is then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{lll}
P &amp;=&amp; (A \sqcup B) / \sim \\
  &amp;=&amp; \{1,2,3,w,x,y,z\} / \sim \\
  &amp;=&amp; \{\{1,x,y\}, \{2,z\}, \{3\}, \{w\}\} \\
  &amp;=&amp; \{[1], [2], [3], [w]\}

<p>Write a careful proof that every group is the group of isomorphisms of a groupoid. In particular, every group is the group of automorphisms of some object in some category.</p>
<p>Let us first remind the definition of a groupoid: a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism.</p>
<p>(Side-note: by "group of isomorphisms", what Aluffi rather meant is "group of isomorphisms (of the single object) in a groupoid (that has a single object)". Otherwise, with multiple objects, things fail: for example, there are multiple identities, one per object, not universally applicable to each object. This is precisely why the notion of "groupoid" was invented, to extend the notion of group in such a way.)</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\((G, \cdot)\)</span> be a group, i.e., some form of algebraic structure with a set of elements <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> and a binary operation <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span> which is associative, unitary, and invertible. We want to show that there exists a groupoid <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((G, \cdot)\)</span> is the group of isomorphisms of <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let us define <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is a single object <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, and its elements are the elements of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> (we could call <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> "<span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>", of course, but we’ll be distinct for pedagogy’s sake). Our goal is to prove that <span class="math inline">\(Hom(X, X)\)</span> is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and thus is itself a group.</p></li>
<li><p>For any element <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span>, there is a unique morphism <span class="math inline">\(f_g \in Hom(X, X)\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in X, f_g(x) = (x \mapsto g \cdot x)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Composition of morphisms is defined as follows: <span class="math inline">\(f_a \circ f_b = (x \mapsto a \cdot (b \cdot x)) = (x \mapsto (a \cdot b) \cdot x) = f_{a \cdot b} \;\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>There is an identity morphism <span class="math inline">\(id_X = (x \to e \cdot x)\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> the identity element of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\forall f \in Hom(X, X), f \circ id_X = f = id_X \circ f\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>It is immediate to see that these morphisms are associative since <span class="math inline">\((G, \cdot)\)</span> is associative. Take <span class="math inline">\(f_a\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(f_b\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(Hom(X,X)\)</span>, for <span class="math inline">\(a,b,c \in X\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((f_a f_b) f_c = (x \to ((a \cdot b) \cdot c) x) = (x \to (a \cdot (b \cdot c))x) = f_a (f_b f_c)\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Every such morphism has an inverse, namely, <span class="math inline">\(f_{g^{-1}} = (x \mapsto g^{-1} \cdot x)\)</span> which by definition of a group necessarily exists. It is easy to verify that <span class="math inline">\(f_g \circ f_{g^{-1}} = f_{g^{-1}} \circ f_g = f_{g \cdot g^{-1}} = f_{g^{-1} \cdot g} = (x \mapsto x = id_X) \;\)</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This is a groupoid, because, it is a category (composition, associativity, identity) where every morphism is an isomorphism (every morphism has an inverse), and the group of isomorphisms of (the single-object category) <span class="math inline">\(\mathcal{C}\)</span>, here <span class="math inline">\(Hom(X,X)\)</span>, is precisely isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\((G, \cdot)\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-47">1.2)</h4>
<p>Consider the ’sets of numbers’ listed in §1.1, and decide which are made into groups by conventional operations such as <span class="math inline">\(+\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\cdot\)</span>. Even if the answer is negative (for example: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, \cdot)\)</span> is not a group), see if variations on the definition of these sets lead to groups (for example, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}^*, \cdot)\)</span> is a group, cf. §1.4). [§1.2]</p>
<p>I suppose Aluffi is referring to §I.1.1, and not §(II.)1.1. In there he mentions:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>: the set of natural numbers (that is, nonnegative integers);</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>: the set of integers;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>: the set of rational numbers;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>: the set of real numbers;</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>: the set of complex numbers.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Let us go through these sets one by one:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N}, +)\)</span> is not a group (needs negative numbers, <span class="math inline">\(x + 5 = 0\)</span> has no solution), and neither is <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N}, \cdot)\)</span> (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(5 \cdot x = 1\)</span> has no solution in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{N}\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}, +)\)</span> is a group, but <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)\)</span> is not because it is not invertible (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(2 \cdot x = 1\)</span> has no solution in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span>).</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Q}, +)\)</span> is a group, but <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Q}, \cdot)\)</span> is not because it is not fully invertible (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(0 \cdot x = 1\)</span> has no solution in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Q}\)</span>). However, remove <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Q}, \cdot)\)</span> and it becomes a group.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, +)\)</span> is a group, but <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, \cdot)\)</span> is not because it is not fully invertible (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(0 \cdot x = 1\)</span> has no solution in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{R}\)</span>). However, remove <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, \cdot)\)</span> and it becomes a group.</p></li>
<li><p><span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>: <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}, +)\)</span> is a group, but <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}, \cdot)\)</span> is not because it is not fully invertible (e.g., <span class="math inline">\(0 \cdot x = 1\)</span> has no solution in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{C}\)</span>). However, remove <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}, \cdot)\)</span> and it becomes a group.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We can see that <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N}, +)\)</span> is not a group, but <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}, +)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Q}, +)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, +)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}, +)\)</span> are all groups. Also, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{N}, \cdot)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}, \cdot)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Q}, \cdot)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}, \cdot)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}, \cdot)\)</span> are not groups. However, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Q}^*, \cdot)\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{R}^*, \cdot)\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{C}^*, \cdot)\)</span> are groups.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-48">1.3)</h4>
<p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\((gh)^{-1} = h^{-1} g^{-1}\)</span> for all elements <span class="math inline">\(g, h\)</span> of a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[(gh)(h^{-1}g^{-1}) = g(hh^{-1})g^{-1} = geg^{-1} = gg^{-1} = e\]</span> <span class="math display">\[(h^{-1}g^{-1})(gh) = h^{-1}(g^{-1}g)h = h^{-1}eh = h^{-1}h = e\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(h^{-1} g^{-1}\)</span> is a 2-sided inverse for <span class="math inline">\(gh\)</span>, and since the inverse of an element in a group is unique, <span class="math inline">\((gh)^{-1} = (h^{-1}g^{-1})\)</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-49">1.4)</h4>
<p>Suppose that <span class="math inline">\(g^2 = e\)</span> for all elements <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> of a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>; prove that <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is commutative.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(forall g \in G, g^2 = e\)</span>, then every element is its own inverse, i.e., multiply by <span class="math inline">\(g^{-1}\)</span> on the left (or right), and we have <span class="math inline">\(\forall g \in G, g = g^{-1}\)</span>. Let be <span class="math inline">\(a, b \in G\)</span>. Then, we have <span class="math inline">\(ba = (ba)^{-1} = a^{-1}b^{-1} = ab\)</span>, which is the definition of commutativity. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is commutative.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-50">1.5)</h4>
<p>The ’multiplication table’ of a group is an array compiling the results of all multiplications <span class="math inline">\(g \cdot h\)</span> (with the value on each row being the left operand, and the value on each column being the right operand; of course the table depends on the order in which the elements are listed in the top row and leftmost column). Prove that every row and every column of the multiplication table of a group contains all elements of the group exactly once (like Sudoku diagrams!).</p>
<p>Another way to phrase this question is "prove that every element of the group can be reached in a single operation from any other (on the left, or on the right, both work)". Written in function notation, this means:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\forall a, b \in G, \exists g_r, g_c \in G, b = g_r \cdot a \text { and } b = a \cdot g_c\]</span></p>
<p>For every element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, we can reach the identity with <span class="math inline">\(a^{-1}\)</span> (on either side). Every element <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> can then be reached from the identity by multiplying it (on either side). We just have to pick the same side both times to find either <span class="math inline">\(g_r = b \cdot a^{-1}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g_c = a^{-1} \cdot b\)</span>. Since the group is closed under "multiplication", both these elements are guaranteed to exist.</p>
<p>This implies that every row and every column of the multiplication table of a group contains all elements of the group exactly once, since any element can be reached in a single multiplication (i.e., there as many possible inputs (1 sided operand) as possible outputs (i.e., applying an operand is an injection) and all outputs are reached (it’s also a surjection)). This also implies that the multiplication table is a "Latin square", which is a square array of <span class="math inline">\(|G|\)</span> symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-51">1.6)</h4>
<p>Prove that there is only one possible multiplication table for <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> has exactly 1, 2, or 3 elements. Analyze the possible multiplication tables for groups with exactly 4 elements, and show that there are two distinct tables, up to reordering the elements of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Use these tables to prove that all groups with <span class="math inline">\(\leq 4\)</span> elements are commutative.</p>
<p>These multiplication tables are usually called "Cayley tables".</p>

<p>The second possibility where one element other than the identity is its own inverse, and the other two are mutual inverses. This gives you a group that is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}_4, +)\)</span> (a four-hour clock with addition, where <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span> are mutual inverses, and <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span> are their own inverse). Note that the permutations of the elements of the group give the same table, so there is only one table for this group up to reordering.</p>
<p>Since the identity and respective inverses commute, all that’s left is to check the commutativity of the self-inverse element <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> with both of the mutual-inverses elements <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span>. In this case, it is because there is "only one option left" in the Latin square that we get commutativity: e.g., <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot b\)</span> cannot equal <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> since they are not inverses, cannot equal <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(b \ne e\)</span>, cannot equal <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(a \ne e\)</span>, so we must have <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot b = c\)</span>. The same reasoning can be applied to <span class="math inline">\(b \cdot a\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> (hence <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot b = b \cdot a\)</span>). With a relabelling, we apply this reasoning to <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot c\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> and to <span class="math inline">\(c \cdot a\)</span> to get <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> (hence <span class="math inline">\(a \cdot c = c \cdot a\)</span>). With this, we have proven commutativity.</p>

<p>With that, we’ve proven that all groups of order <span class="math inline">\(\leq 4\)</span> are commutative.</p>
<p>(Note that the commutativity can also be "seen" in all these tables by the fact that they are their own transpose.)</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-52">1.7)</h4>
<p>Prove Corollary 1.11: Let <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> be an element of finite order, and let <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. Then <span class="math inline">\(g^n = e \Leftrightarrow \exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, n = k|g|\)</span> (<span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>).</p>
<p>By Lemma 1.10, if <span class="math inline">\(g^n = e\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, n = k|g|\)</span>.</p>
<p>For the converse, we suppose <span class="math inline">\(\exists k \in \mathbb{Z}, n = k|g|\)</span>. By definition of the order of a group element, <span class="math inline">\(g^{|g|} = e\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(g^n = g^{|g|k} = (g^{|g|})^k = e^k = e\)</span>. Hence, <span class="math inline">\(g^n = e\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-53">1.8)</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a finite group, with exactly one element <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> of order <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_{g \in G} g = f\)</span>.</p>
<p>I had some trouble, so I checked online and found this, meaning that the group probably needs to be not just finite but also abelian:</p>
<p>https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/2550052/let-g-be-a-finite-abelian-group-with-exactly-one-element-of-order-2-denoted</p>
<p>(A couple of notes: since <span class="math inline">\(f^2 = e \Leftrightarrow f = f^{-1}\)</span>, it also means that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the only self-inverse (involution) in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>. Also, the order of operation is not given: this gives us a hint that the property <span class="math inline">\((\Pi_{g \in G} \; g)^2 = e\)</span> does not rely on the order of operations.)</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the only element which is a self-inverse of order <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> is the only self-inverse of order <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, we have that for all other elements a <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is not its own inverse. This means that the product of all elements of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a product of pairs of inverses, which cancel out to the identity (given commutativity), except for the self-inverse <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> which remains. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(\Pi_{g \in G} g = f\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-54">1.9)</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a finite group, of order <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and let <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> be the number of elements <span class="math inline">\(g \in G\)</span> of order exactly <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>. Prove that <span class="math inline">\(n - m\)</span> is odd. Deduce that if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even then <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> necessarily contains elements of order <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<p>(This would be trivial if we could use Lagrange’s theorem.)</p>
<p>Let us consider the set of elements of <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> of order <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(M = \{ g \in G \mid |g| = 2 \}\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(|M| = m\)</span>. We know that for all <span class="math inline">\(g \in M\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(g = g^{-1}\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(M\)</span> is the set of self-inverse elements (not counting <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>). This means that <span class="math inline">\(G - M\)</span> contains only pairs of inverses (with <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> such pairs), and the self-inverse <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>, so has its cardinal can be written <span class="math inline">\(|G - M| = |G| - |M| = n - m = 2k + 1\)</span>, i.e., it is an odd number.</p>
<p>If <span class="math inline">\(|G| = n\)</span> is even, then it can be written as <span class="math inline">\(2l\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(l \in \mathbb{N}\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(l &gt; k\)</span>. Consequently <span class="math inline">\(|M| = |G| - (n - m) = 2l - (2k + 1) = 2(l - k) - 1\)</span>, which is odd, and <span class="math inline">\(&gt; 0\)</span> since <span class="math inline">\(l &gt; k\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> necessarily contains at least <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> element of order <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-55">1.10)</h4>
<p>Suppose the order of <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> is odd. What can you say about the order of <span class="math inline">\(g^2\)</span> ?</p>
<p>We write <span class="math inline">\(|g| = 2k + 1\)</span> since it is odd.</p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(g^{|g|} = e \Rightarrow (g^2)^{|g|} = (g^{|g|})^2 = e^2 = e\)</span></p>
<p>By Corollary 1.11, <span class="math inline">\((g^2)^{|g|} = (g^2)^{2k + 1} = e \Leftrightarrow \exists l \in \mathbb{N}, |g| = 2k + 1 = l|g^2|\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> is odd, both <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|g^2|\)</span> must be odd.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-56">1.11)</h4>
<p>Prove that for all <span class="math inline">\(g, h\)</span> in a group <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = |hg|\)</span>. (Hint: prove that <span class="math inline">\(|aga^{-1}| = |g|\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(a, g \in G\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(a, g \in G\)</span>.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{array}{ll}
(aga^{-1})^{|g|} &amp;= (aga^{-1})(aga^{-1})...(aga^{-1}) \\

                 &amp;= ag^{|g|}a^{-1} \\
                 &amp;= aea^{-1} \\
                 &amp;= (aa^{-1}) \\
                 &amp;= e
\end{array}\]</span></p>
<p>By Lemma 1.10, <span class="math inline">\(|aga^{-1}|\)</span> is a divisor of <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>.</p>
<p>By definition, <span class="math inline">\((aga^{-1})^{|aga^{-1}|} = e\)</span>. However, similarly to above, <span class="math inline">\((aga^{-1})^{|aga^{-1}|} = ag^{|aga^{-1}|}a^{-1}\)</span>. So we have <span class="math inline">\(ag^{|aga^{-1}|}a^{-1} = e\)</span>; then, multiplying on the left by <span class="math inline">\(a^{-1}\)</span> and right by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>, we get <span class="math inline">\(g^{|aga^{-1}|} = e\)</span>. By Lemma 1.10, <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> is a divisor of <span class="math inline">\(|aga^{-1}|\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since the divisibility relation is an order relation (antisymmetric), the only time two numbers can be mutually divisors of each other is if we’re in the reflexive case (i.e., they are equal). Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(|g| = |aga^{-1}|\)</span>.</p>
<p>Applying this identity to the elements <span class="math inline">\(g \to gh\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(a \to h\)</span>, we have <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = |(h)(gh)(h^{-1})| = |hg|\)</span></p>

<p><span class="underline">Inheritance:</span></p>
<p>We suppose <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> true for a specific <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we’ll show that <span class="math inline">\(P(n+1)\)</span> holds.</p>

<p>By induction, <span class="math inline">\(P(n)\)</span> is true for all <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, there exists no <span class="math inline">\(n \geq 1\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\((gh)^n = I_2\)</span>, hence <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = \infty\)</span>.</p>

<p>Give an example showing that <span class="math inline">\(|gh|\)</span> is not necessarily equal to <span class="math inline">\(\text{lcm}(|g|, |h|)\)</span>, even if <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> commute. [§1.6, 1.14]</p>
<p>We take the 6-hour clock <span class="math inline">\(Z_6\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(g = h = [3]_6\)</span>, the equivalence class of 3 modulo 6. We have <span class="math inline">\(g^2 = h^2 = gh = hg = [3]_6 + [3]_6 = [6]_6 = [0]_6\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(|g| = |h| = 2\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = 1\)</span>. However, <span class="math inline">\(\text{lcm}(|g|, |h|) = 2 \ne |gh| = 1\)</span></p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-59">1.14)</h4>
<p>As a counterpoint to Exercise 1.13, prove that if <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> commute, and <span class="math inline">\(\text{gcd}(|g|, |h|) = 1\)</span> (they are coprime), then <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = |g| |h|\)</span>. (Hint: let <span class="math inline">\(N = |gh|\)</span>; then <span class="math inline">\(g^N = (h^{-1})^N\)</span>. What can you say about this element?) [§1.6, 1.15, §IV.2.5]</p>
<p>First, we remark that for any <span class="math inline">\(x \in G\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(x^N = e \Leftrightarrow e = (x^{-1})^N\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(|x| = |x^{-1}|\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have that <span class="math inline">\(\text{gcd}(|g|, |h|) = 1\)</span>, and we know that <span class="math inline">\(|g| |h| = \text{gcd}(|g|, |h|) \text{lcm}(|g|, |h|)\)</span> so we have <span class="math inline">\(|g||h| = \text{lcm}(|g|, |h|)\)</span>.</p>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(N = |gh|\)</span>. Then, given that <span class="math inline">\((gh)^N = e\)</span>, that <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> commute, and multiplying by <span class="math inline">\((h^{-1})^N\)</span> on the right of both side, we have <span class="math inline">\((gh)^N(h^{-1})^N = g^N h^N (h^{-1})^N = g^N (hh^{-1})^N = g^N = e(h^{-1})^N = (h^{-1})^N\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(g^N = (h^{-1})^N = f\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now study <span class="math inline">\(f^{|g|}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f^{|h|}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We have <span class="math inline">\(f^{|g|} = (g^N)^{|g|} = g^{N|g|} = e\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, <span class="math inline">\(e = h^{|h|} = (h^{-1})^{|h|} = ((h^{-1})^{|h|})^N = ((h^{-1})^N)^{|h|} = f^{|h|}\)</span> (by our initial remark).</p>
<p>Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(M = |f| = |g^N| = |(h^{-1})^N| = |h^N|\)</span> divides both <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> are coprime, <span class="math inline">\(M = 1\)</span>. Therefore <span class="math inline">\(f = g^N = e\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(N = |gh|\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(f = (h^{-1})^N = e\)</span> so <span class="math inline">\(N = |gh|\)</span> is a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(|h^{-1}| = |h|\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> are coprime, we can further say that <span class="math inline">\(|gh|\)</span> is a multiple of their LCM/product <span class="math inline">\(|g||h|\)</span> (using, for example, the fundamental theorem of arithmetic).</p>
<p>Using Proposition 1.14 (i.e, if <span class="math inline">\(gh = hg\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(|gh|\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(\text{lcm}(|g|, |h|)\)</span>), we can also tell that <span class="math inline">\(N = |gh|\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(\text{lcm}(|g|, |h|) = |g| |h|\)</span>.</p>
<p>Putting both results together using the antisymmetry of the divisibility relation, we have <span class="math inline">\(N = |gh| = |g||h|\)</span>.</p>
<h4 class="unnumbered" id="section-60">1.15)</h4>
<p>Let <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> be a commutative group, and let <span class="math inline">\(g \in G\)</span> be an element of maximal finite order: that is, such that if <span class="math inline">\(h \in G\)</span> has finite order then <span class="math inline">\(|h| \leq |g|\)</span>. Prove that in fact if <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> has finite order in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>. (Hint: argue by contradiction. If <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> is finite but does not divide <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>, then there is a prime integer <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(|g| = p^m r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|h| = p^n s\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> relatively prime to <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(m &lt; n\)</span>. Use Exercise 1.14 (the fact that the order of the product of two elements with coprime order is equal to the product of their orders) to compute the order of <span class="math inline">\(g^{p^m} h^s\)</span>.) [§2.1, 4.11, IV.6.15]</p>
<p>We suppose that <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> is finite but does not divide <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>. Using the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, if <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> doesn’t divide <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>, then it has at least one prime factor that <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> does not have. Then, there is a prime integer <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(|g| = p^m r\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|h| = p^n s\)</span>, with <span class="math inline">\(r\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> (potentially composite), both independently coprime with <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq m &lt; n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We know from exercise 1.14 that if 2 elements <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> commute (which is always the case in a commutative group like here), if the two elements have coprime order, then <span class="math inline">\(|ab| = |a||b|\)</span>.</p>
<p>The order <span class="math inline">\(|x^k|\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(x^k\)</span>, is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{|x|}{\text{gcd}(|x|, k)}\)</span>, assuming <span class="math inline">\(|x|\)</span> is finite (Proposition 1.13).</p>
<p>We study <span class="math inline">\(g^{p^m} h^s\)</span>.</p>
<p>The order of <span class="math inline">\(g^{p^m}\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(\frac{|g|}{\text{gcd}(|g|, p^m)} = \frac{p^m r}{p^m} = r\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(p^m\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>.</p>
<p>Similarly, the order of <span class="math inline">\(h^s\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(|h|/\text{gcd}(|h|, s) = \frac{p^n s}{s} = p^n\)</span> because <span class="math inline">\(s\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span>.</p>
<p>Since <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is a commutative group, <span class="math inline">\(g^{p^m}\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h^s\)</span> commute. By Exercise 1.14, <span class="math inline">\(|g^{p^m} h^s| = |g^{p^m}| |h^s| = p^n r = p^{n-m} (p^m r) = p^{n-m} |g| &gt; |g|\)</span>.</p>
<p>This is a contradiction with the fact that <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> has <em>maximal</em> finite order. Therefore, our assumption that <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> does not divide <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span> must be false.</p>
<p>Conclusion: if <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is an abelian group, <span class="math inline">\(g \in G\)</span> has maximal finite order, and <span class="math inline">\(h \in G\)</span> has finite order in <span class="math inline">\(G\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(|h|\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(|g|\)</span>.</p>

Keeping the last element fixed, we see that the portion of <span class="math inline">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> that can permute is isomorphic to <span class="math inline">\(S_k\)</span>: by our hypothesis, it thus has elements of order <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> for all <span class="math inline">\(d \leq k\)</span>. We just need to show that we can find an element of order <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(S_{k+1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We take the a cyclic permutation of all elements (which acts like a Caesar cypher of distance parameter <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>): each <span class="math inline">\(i &gt; 1\)</span> is mapped to to <span class="math inline">\(i-1\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is mapped to <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>. Let us prove that this permutation has order <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can see that the cycle of this permutation is <span class="math inline">\(1 \rightarrow k+1 \rightarrow k \rightarrow k-1 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow 1\)</span>, which has length <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now show that the order of any cyclic permutation is the length of the cycle. Let be <span class="math inline">\(S_n\)</span> a permutation group and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> a cycle in it, generated by a permutation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span>. We denote elements of the cycle as <span class="math inline">\(c_1, c_2, \ldots, c_m\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m \leq n\)</span> such that the cycle can be expressed as <span class="math inline">\(c_1 \rightarrow c_2 \rightarrow \ldots \rightarrow c_m \rightarrow c_1\)</span>. We have that <span class="math inline">\(\forall j \in [[1, m]], \sigma^0(c_j) = c_j\)</span>, trivially. Then, we have <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^1(c_j) = c_{[j]_m + 1}\)</span> (meaning <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> modulo <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> plus <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>), and so on. We see that <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^{n-1}(c_j) = c_{[j]_m + n-1}\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma^n(c_j) = c_{[j]_m + n} = c_{[j]_m} = c_j\)</span>. Therefore, the order of <span class="math inline">\(\sigma\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>, the length of the cycle.</p>
<p>Therefore, we have shown that <span class="math inline">\(S_{k+1}\)</span> has cyclic permutations of length <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>, and thus elements of order <span class="math inline">\(k+1\)</span>, which completes the proof.</p>

<p>Describe generators and relations for all dihedral groups <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span>. (Hint: let <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> be the reflection about a line through the center of a regular <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-gon and a vertex, and let <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> be counterclockwise rotation by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi/n\)</span>. The group <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span> will be generated by <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>, subject to three relations. To see that these relations really determine <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span>, use them to show that any product <span class="math inline">\(x^{i_1} y^{i_2} x^{i_3} y^{i_4} \ldots\)</span> equals <span class="math inline">\(x^i y^j\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(j\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq i \leq 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq j &lt; n\)</span>.)</p>
<p>Two of the relations are very easy to see: <span class="math inline">\(x^2 = e\)</span> (for any axial symmetry flip <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(y^n = e\)</span> (for any <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>-rotation <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>). Another hint (given at the bottom of page 52, as done on an imaginary pentagon) tells us to study <span class="math inline">\(yxyx\)</span> (hinting that it is equal to <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>).</p>
<p>We first note that <span class="math inline">\(x^{-1} = x\)</span> since any axial symmetry is an involution. Geometrically speaking, we can see that the operation <span class="math inline">\(x^{-1}yx\)</span> is a rotation by <span class="math inline">\(2\pi/n\)</span> in the opposite direction to <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>. We can thus write <span class="math inline">\(x^{-1}yx = y^{-1}\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\(yxyx = e\)</span>. This is our 3rd relation, which we can also rewrite as <span class="math inline">\(yx = = x^{-1}y^{-1} = xy^{n-1}\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can now write any element of <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(x^i y^j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq i \leq 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq j &lt; n\)</span>. Any power of <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> (if the exponent is even) or <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (if the exponent is odd), any power <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> of <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> reduces to <span class="math inline">\(y^{[k]_n}\)</span>, and any <span class="math inline">\(yx\)</span> term sandwiched between an <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and a <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> terms can be changed to <span class="math inline">\(xy^{n-1}\)</span> in order to reduce with the <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> (or <span class="math inline">\(e\)</span>) on the left, and the <span class="math inline">\(y^{[k]_n}\)</span> on the right. Through this algorithm, we can always get an element of the form <span class="math inline">\(x^i y^j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq i \leq 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq j &lt; n\)</span>.</p>

<p>For every positive integer <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> construct a group containing two elements <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(|g| = 2\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(|h| = 2\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = n\)</span>. (Hint: for <span class="math inline">\(n &gt; 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span> will do.) [§1.6]</p>
<p>We can take the dihedral group <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span>, and take the reflection <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> and the rotation <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span> (as defined in the previous exercise). Taking <span class="math inline">\(g = x\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(h = xy\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(|g| = |x| = 2\)</span> (by the first relation), <span class="math inline">\(|h| = |xy| = 2\)</span> (by the third relation) and <span class="math inline">\(|gh| = |xxy| = |y| = n\)</span> (by the second relation).</p>
<p>As for the case with <span class="math inline">\(n = 1\)</span>, we take the group <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}_2, +)\)</span> and set <span class="math inline">\(g = h = 1\)</span>; their sum is the identity <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, which has order <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> (technically, to stay in the <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span> picture, this is isomorphic to the group of symmtries of a "2-gon", a line, with either the identity, or a flip across its mediatrix).</p>

<p>Find all elements of <span class="math inline">\(D_{2n}\)</span> that commute with every other element. (The parity of n plays a role.)</p>
<p>A pair of elements commute iff <span class="math inline">\(xy = yx\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> be our test element. We want <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> to have the property <span class="math inline">\(\forall x \in D_{2n}, ax = xa\)</span>. We can write <span class="math inline">\(a = x^i y^j\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq i \leq 1\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq j &lt; n\)</span>. We have that <span class="math inline">\(ax = x^i y^j x = x^i y^{j-1}(yx) = x^i y^{j-1} x y^{-1} = x^i y^{j-2} x y^{-2} = \ldots = x^{i+1} y^{-j} = x x^i y^{-j} = xa&#39;\)</span>. Therefore, only elements such that <span class="math inline">\(a&#39; = x^i y^{-j} = x^i y^j = a\)</span> commute, this is equivalent (by cancelling the eventual <span class="math inline">\(x\)</span> on both sides and aggregating the <span class="math inline">\(y\)</span>’s) to <span class="math inline">\(y^{2j} = e\)</span>, which is true iff <span class="math inline">\(j = 0\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(2j = n\)</span>. Therefore, if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, only the identity commutes with all elements, and if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, both the identity and the rotation of angle <span class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span> commute with all elements.</p>

<p>Verify carefully that ’congruence mod <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>’ is an equivalence relation.</p>

<p>Reflexivity:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\forall a \in \mathbb{Z}, a - a = 0 = 0 \cdot n \Rightarrow a \sim a\]</span></p>
<p>Symmetry:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

<p>Prove that <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> contains precisely <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements.</p>
<p>Each element of <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> can be written uniquely as <span class="math inline">\(m + kn\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(m \in [[0, n-1]]\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. Therefore, we have <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> possible values for <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span>. Because congruence modulo <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> equates two numbers in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> if their difference is a multiple of <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, we have that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(m + kn\)</span> are equivalent. Therefore, we can consider an equivalence class associated with <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> to contain all elements of the form <span class="math inline">\(m + kn\)</span>. Since we have precisely <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> such equivalence classes, <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> contains precisely <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> elements.</p>

<p>Prove that the square of every odd integer is congruent to 1 modulo 8. [§VII.5.1]</p>
<p>We write an odd integer as <span class="math inline">\(2n + 1\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(n \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. We have that <span class="math inline">\((2n + 1)^2 = 4n^2 + 4n + 1 = 4(n^2 + n) + 1\)</span>. We can see that <span class="math inline">\(n^2 + n\)</span> is always even, because: if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, then <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is even, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is even, so their sum is even; and if <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math inline">\(n^2\)</span> is odd, and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> is odd, so their sum is even. Therefore, we can write <span class="math inline">\(n^2 + n = 2m\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(m \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>, and thus <span class="math inline">\((2n + 1)^2 = 8m + 1\)</span>, which is congruent to 1 modulo 8.</p>

<p>Prove that there are no integers <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a^2 + b^2 = 3c^2\)</span>. (Hint: by studying the equation <span class="math inline">\([a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 = 3[c]^2_4\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, show that <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> would all have to be even. Letting <span class="math inline">\(a = 2k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b = 2l\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c = 2m\)</span>, you would have <span class="math inline">\(k^2 + l^2 = 3m^2\)</span>. What’s wrong with that?)</p>
<p>We can write <span class="math inline">\(a^2 + b^2 = 3c^2\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(a^2 + b^2 = 3c^2 + 4k\)</span> with <span class="math inline">\(k = 0\)</span>. Any solution to the first equation must thus respect the properties of the second equation. We study these properties by looking at the equation modulo 4.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}
[a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 = [3]_4 [c]^2_4
&amp;\Leftrightarrow [a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 = [-1]_4 ([c]^2_4) \\
&amp;\Leftrightarrow [a]^2_4 + [b]^2_4 + [c]^2_4 = [0]_4 \\
\end{aligned}\]</span></p>
<p>Since 0 is even, this condition gives us that either two of the numbers have to be odd, or none of them are. However, looking back at the first equation, if <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is even, then <span class="math inline">\([c]^2_4 = 0\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\([3]_4 [c]^2_4 = 0\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must be both even or both odd. If <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> are both odd (i.e., either congruent to <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(-1\)</span>), then <span class="math inline">\([a]^2_4 = 1\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\([b]^2_4 = 1\)</span> and their sum, supposedly equal to <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span>, is congruent to <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>, which is a contradiction. In this case, both <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must be even.</p>
<p>Now if <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is odd, then <span class="math inline">\([3]_4 [c]^2_4 = [3]_4 [1]_4 = [3]_4 = [-1]_4\)</span>. Since <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> is odd, only one of <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> or <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span> must be odd. Without loss of generality, we choose that to be <span class="math inline">\(b\)</span>, in which case <span class="math inline">\([b]^2_4 = 1\)</span>. Our "the three sum to 0" equation above then tells us that <span class="math inline">\([a]^2_4 + [2]_4 = [0]_4\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\([a]^2_4 = [2]_4\)</span>, which is a contradiction, because there is no number <span class="math inline">\([a]_4\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\([a]^2_4 = [2]_4\)</span> (the image of the squaring function is <span class="math inline">\(\{ [0]_4, [1]_4 \}\)</span>). Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(c\)</span> cannot be odd.</p>
<p>We’ve thus shown that the only case not leading to a contradition is the case where all three numbers are even, and this applies to the original equation.</p>
<p>Letting <span class="math inline">\(a = 2k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(b = 2l\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(c = 2m\)</span>, you would have <span class="math inline">\(k^2 + l^2 = 3m^2\)</span>, which is just a rewriting of our initial equation. After iteration this process until a maximal instance of <span class="math inline">\(2\)</span>’s has been removed from the prime factorization of each number, we will eventually reach a point where either <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(l\)</span>, or (non-exclusive) <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> is odd, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there are no integers <span class="math inline">\(a, b, c\)</span> such that <span class="math inline">\(a^2 + b^2 = 3c^2\)</span>.</p>
<p>This exercise is interesting because it teaches us that number theoretic equations that rely on odd and evenness can effectively be studied using <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/4\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.</p>

<p>We suppose that <span class="math inline">\(\exists a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, am + bn = 1\)</span>. We can write this as <span class="math inline">\(am = 1 - bn\)</span>, which means that <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> divides <span class="math inline">\(1 - bn\)</span>. Suppose <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> have a common prime factor <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span>: this prime factor would divide <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span>, and thus would divide <span class="math inline">\(1 - bn\)</span> (equivalently its opposite <span class="math inline">\(bn - 1\)</span>) and <span class="math inline">\(bn\)</span>. However, this is a contradiction, because the only number that can divide two numbers that are off by <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Therefore, <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(n\)</span> have no common prime factors, and <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(m, n) = 1\)</span>.</p>

<p>State and prove an analog of Lemma 2.2, showing that the multiplication on <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> is a well-defined operation.</p>
<p>We remind Lemma 2.2: If <span class="math inline">\(a \equiv a&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span> and<span class="math inline">\(b \equiv b&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((a + b) \equiv (a&#39; + b&#39;) \text{mod} n\)</span>.</p>
<p>Our analogue is thus: <span class="math inline">\(a \equiv a&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span> and<span class="math inline">\(b \equiv b&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\((a \times b) \equiv (a&#39; \times b&#39;) \text{mod} n\)</span>.</p>
<p>We now show that it is well-defined (there exists a commutative square diagram with an epimorphism from <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> in one direction, and with the respective multiplications in the other). We take <span class="math inline">\(a \equiv a&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span> and<span class="math inline">\(b \equiv b&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span>. This means that <span class="math inline">\(a - a&#39; = kn\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b - b&#39; = ln\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(k, l \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. We have that <span class="math inline">\(ab - a&#39;b&#39; = ab - ab&#39; + ab&#39; - a&#39;b&#39; = a(b - b&#39;) + (a - a&#39;)b&#39; = a(ln) + (kn)b&#39; = n(al + kb&#39;)\)</span>. The first and last terms of this equation give us that <span class="math inline">\(ab \equiv a&#39;b&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span>, as needed.</p>

<li><p>Prove that if <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(r, 2n) = 1\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(\frac{r+n}{2}, n) = 1\)</span>. (Ditto.)</p></li>

<p>Find the last digit of <span class="math inline">\(1238237^{18238456}\)</span>. (Work in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}\)</span>.)</p>
<p>We note that <span class="math inline">\(7^2 = 49\)</span>, <span class="math inline">\(7^3 = 343\)</span>, and <span class="math inline">\(7^4 = 2401\)</span>, so the order of <span class="math inline">\(7\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\((\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}, \times)^*\)</span> is <span class="math inline">\(4\)</span>. Since multiplication is well-defined in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/10\mathbb{Z}\)</span>, we have:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\begin{aligned}

&amp;= ([7]_{10}^4)^{4559614} \\

<p>We use the result from exercise 2.13: <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(m, n) = 1 \Leftrightarrow \exists a, b \in \mathbb{Z}, am + bn = 1\)</span>; similarly, <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(m&#39;, n) = 1 \Leftrightarrow \exists a&#39;, b&#39; \in \mathbb{Z}, a&#39;m&#39; + b&#39;n = 1\)</span>. We have that <span class="math inline">\(m \equiv m&#39; \text{mod} n\)</span>, so <span class="math inline">\(m - m&#39; = kn\)</span> for some <span class="math inline">\(k \in \mathbb{Z}\)</span>. We can rewrite this as <span class="math inline">\(m = m&#39; + kn\)</span>. We can now substitute <span class="math inline">\(m\)</span> in Bézout’s identity: <span class="math inline">\(a(m&#39; + kn) + bn = 1 \Rightarrow am&#39; + akn + bn = 1\)</span>. We can now let <span class="math inline">\(a&#39; = a + ak\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(b&#39; = b\)</span>, and we have that <span class="math inline">\(\gcd(m, n) = 1 \Leftrightarrow \gcd(m&#39;, n) = 1\)</span>.</p>

<p>For <span class="math inline">\(d \leq n\)</span>, define an injective function <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z} \to S_n\)</span> preserving the operation: that is, such that the sum of equivalence classes in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> corresponds to the product of the corresponding permutations.</p>
<p>We can define the function <span class="math inline">\(f: \mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z} \to S_n\)</span> as <span class="math inline">\(f([a]_d) = \sigma_a\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_a\)</span> is the permutation that maps <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i + a\)</span> modulo <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> (our Caesar cypher mentioned above, over the <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> first elements, or any choice of <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> elements really).</p>
<p>This function is injective because the permutation <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_a\)</span> is uniquely determined by <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>. This can immediately be seen by studying with which element the first element (which we can label 0) is replaced: it is replaced with <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span> (the <span class="math inline">\(a\)</span>-th element), leading to <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> distinct outputs for <span class="math inline">\(d\)</span> possible inputs. More formally, if <span class="math inline">\(a,b \in \mathbb{Z}/d\mathbb{Z}, a \neq b\)</span>, then <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(\sigma_b\)</span> are distinct permutations, as they map <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(i + a\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(i + b\)</span> respectively, and <span class="math inline">\(a \neq b\)</span> implies that <span class="math inline">\(i + a \neq i + b\)</span> for any <span class="math inline">\(i\)</span>.</p>
<p>We can see that the sum of equivalence classes in <span class="math inline">\(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}\)</span> corresponds to the product of the corresponding permutations through the following commutative diagram:</p>
