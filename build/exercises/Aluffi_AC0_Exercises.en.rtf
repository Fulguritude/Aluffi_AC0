{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In a nutshell, Russell\u8217's paradox proves, by contradiction, that certain mathematical collections cannot be sets. It posits the existence of a "set of all sets that don\u8217't contain themselves". Such a set can neither contain itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that does contain itself", and should be excluded); nor can it exclude it itself (since in that case, it would be a "set that doesn\u8217't contain itself", and should be included).\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Prove that any equivalence relation over a set {\i S} defines a partition of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 a) \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} has no empty elements: any element in {\i S} is part of at least one equivalence class, the class containing at least that element itself. Since there is no equivalence class constructed independently from elements, there are no empty equivalence classes.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 b) Elements of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} are disjoint: suppose there is an element {\i x} that is part of {\i A} and {\i B}, two distinct equivalence classes. \u8704?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a} and \u8704?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i B},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}. By transivity through {\i x}, \u8704?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?\u8704?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i B},\u8198?{\i a}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}. Therefore, {\i A} and {\i B} are the same equivalence class: {\i A}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i B}. Contradiction. Therefore all elements of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} are disjoint subsets of {\i S}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 c) The union of all elements of \u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}} makes up {\i S}: suppose \u8707?{\i x}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S} such that {\i x}\u8196?\u8713?\u8196?\u8899?{\sub {\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}}}{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}. From the argument made in (a), {\i x} exists in at least one equivalence class, the class which contains only {\i x} itself. This is one of ou {\i S}{\sub {\i i}} sets. Contradiction. Therefore, \u8899?{\sub {\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?{\sub {\i S}}}{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Given a partition \u55349?\u56491? on a set {\i S}, show how to define a relation \u8764? on {\i S} such that {\i P} is the corresponding partition.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The insight here is to build an equivalence relation such that two elements are equivalent if and only if they are part of the same subset of {\i S}, which is understood as their common equivalence class.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We define \u8764? such that \u8704?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?,\u8198?\u8704?{\i x}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?\u8704?{\i y}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i y}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let us prove that \u8764? is an equivalence relation.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 a) Reflexivity: \u8704?{\i A}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?,\u8198?\u8704?{\i x}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A},\u8198?{\i A}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i A}\u8196?\u8658?\u8196?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i x}\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 b) Symmetry: \u8704?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u55349?\u56491?,\u8198?\u8704?{\i x}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}},\u8198?\u8704?{\i y}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}},\u8198?{\i x}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i y}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i j}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i i}}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i y}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i x}\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 c) Transitivity:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 $$\\begin\{aligned\}
\\forall S_i, S_j, S_k \\in \\mathcal\{P\}, \\forall x \\in S_i, \\forall y \\in S_j, \\forall z \\in S_k, \\\\
(x \\sim y) \\cap (y \\sim z) \\\\
    \\Leftrightarrow \\\\
(S_i = S_j) \\cap (S_j = S_k) \\\\
    \\Rightarrow \\\\
S_i = S_k \\\\
    \\Leftrightarrow \\\\

\\end\{aligned\}$$\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Therefore, \u8764? is indeed an equivalence relation, and is generated uniquely by the partition.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs24 1.4)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 How many different equivalence relations may be defined on the set \{1,\u8198?2,\u8198?3\}?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If we start with the 1 element set, we have only one possible partition, one possible equivalence class.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 With the 2 element set, there are 2 partitions, \{\{1,\u8198?2\}\} and \{\{1\},\u8198?\{2\}\}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 With the 3 element set, there is:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab 1 partition of type 1-1-1: \{\{1\},\u8198?\{2\},\u8198?\{3\}\}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab 3 partitions of type 2-1: \{\{1\},\u8198?\{2,\u8198?3\}\}, \{\{2\},\u8198?\{1,\u8198?3\}\}, and \{\{3\},\u8198?\{1,\u8198?2\}\}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab 1 partition of type 3: \{\{1,\u8198?2,\u8198?3\}\}.\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Hence, there are five equivalence classes on the 3 element set.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 See the Bell numbers: https://oeis.org/A000110\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Give an example of a relation that is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive. What happens if you attempt to use this relation to define a partition on the set?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let\u8217's imagine a "similarity relation" we can notate with \u8771?. We can imagine it to work like a looser version of equality (say for example, if an integer is only 1 away, then it counts as similar).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab reflexive: \u8704?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S},\u8198?{\i a}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i a} (an element is always "similar" to itself)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab symmetric: \u8704?{\i a},\u8198?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S},\u8198?{\i a}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i b}\u8196?\u8658?\u8196?{\i b}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i a} ("similarity" goes both ways)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab not transitive: \u8707?{\i a},\u8198?{\i b},\u8198?{\i c}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S},\u8198?({\i a}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i b})\u8197?\u8743?\u8197?({\i b}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i c})\u8197?\u8743?\u8197?\u172?({\i a}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i c}) (just because {\i a}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i b} and {\i b}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i c} are similar, that doesn\u8217't mean {\i a}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i c} works, because it is possible for the "similarity gap" to be too large to qualify as "similar". E.g.: ({\i a},\u8198?{\i b},\u8198?{\i c})\u8196?=\u8196?(1,\u8198?2,\u8198?3).).\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If we use this to define a partition {\i P} on some set {\i S}: {\i S}/\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?\u8196?:=\u8196?{\i P}{\sub \u8771?}, there is ambiguity as to which element should go into which equivalence class.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This idea deserves further discussion.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In terms of graph theory, if we express a set with an internal relation as a graph, we can represent elements as nodes and relationships as edges. Reflexivity means that every node has a loop (unary, self-edge). Symmetry means that the graph is not directed (since every relationship goes both ways). Transitivity means that every connected subset of nodes is a maximal clique (synonymously, every connected component is a complete subgraph).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In a relation which is reflexive and symmetric, but not transitive, you would have connected components of this graph which are not cliques. For these, there is ambiguity as to how you would group their nodes. Two obvious choices would be either:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab to remove the minimal number of edges to obtain n distinct cliques (thereby gaining the {\i transitive restriction} of the relation) from a given non-clique; or\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab to complete the connected subgraph into a clique (thereby gaining the {\i transitive closure} of the relation).\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs24 1.6)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Define a relation \u8764? on the set \u8477? of real numbers, by setting {\i a}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i b}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484?. Prove that this is an equivalence relation, and find a \u8217'compelling\u8217' description for \u8477?/\u8764?. Do the same for the relation \u8776? on the plane \u8477?\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8477? defined by declaring ({\i a}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i a}{\sub 2})\u8196?\u8776?\u8196?({\i b}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 2})\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i b}{\sub 1}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i a}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484? and {\i b}{\sub 2}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i a}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484?.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 TODO: forgot to prove that it\u8217's an equivalence relation\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 {\i b}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484? means that 2 real numbers differ by an integral amount. This means that the equivalence relation algebraically describes the idea that "with this relation, 2 real numbers are the same iff they have the same fractional component {\i x} (or 1\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i x} for negative numbers)". Eg, 4.76\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?1024.76\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?5.34, since \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?5.34\u8197?+\u8197?10\u8196?=\u8196?4.76, etc.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 To make an algebraic quotient of a set by an equivalence relation, we take the function which maps each element to its corresponding equivalence class, in the set (partition) containing these equivalence class. Intuitively, this is similar to keeping only one representative element per equivalence class. For the example class above, we can keep the representative 0.76. There is such an equivalence class for every fractional part possible, that is, one for every number in [0,\u8198?1[. The corresponding map is the "real remainder of division modulo 1". This map is well-defined because each real number has only one output for this map, and all real numbers that are equivalent through \u8764? are mapped to the same value in the output set.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We should also notice that since 0\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?1, this space loops around on itself. Intuitively, if you increase linearly in the input space \u8477?, it goes back to 0 after 0.9999999... in the output space. This output space is thus a circle of perimeter 1.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Similarly, {\i b}{\sub 1}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i a}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484? and {\i b}{\sub 2}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?{\i a}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484? means that 2 points in the 2D plane are the same iff they differ in each coordinate by an integral amount. This boils down to combining two such loops from the first part of the exercise: one in the {\i x} direction and one in the {\i y} direction: what this gives is the small square [0,\u8198?1[\u8197?\u215?\u8197?[0,\u8198?1[, which loops to {\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?0 (resp. {\i y}\u8196?=\u8196?0) when {\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?1 (resp. {\i y}\u8196?=\u8196?1) is reached. This space functions like a small torus, of area 1.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We will construct a pre-inverse for {\i f}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The insight here is to realize that a surjection divides its input set into a partition, where each 2-by-2 disjoint subset corresponds to {\i f}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}(\{{\i q}\}), for every {\i q} in the output set. More formally, each "fiber" (preimage of a singleton) is a disjoint subset of the input set, and the union of fibers is the input set itself. You can see this in the following diagram:\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Using AC, we select a single element from each such fiber. For each {\i q}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i B}, we name {\i p}{\sub {\i q}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i f}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}(\{{\i q}\}) the chosen element. We define {\i g} as {\i g}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i B}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}),\u8198?{\i g}\u8196?=\u8196?({\i q}\u8196?\u8614?\u8196?{\i p}{\sub {\i q}}).

Thus, {\i f} has a preinverse.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 A section is the preinverse of a surjection. Here, the surjection in question is {\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}} the projection of {\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B} onto {\i A}.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We now consider the function which maps an input {\i a}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A} of {\i f} to its "geometric representation" (its coordinates in the enclosing space {\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}, corresponding to a point of the graph {\i \u915?}{\sub {\i f}}). {\i f\u770?}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i A}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})),\u8198?{\i f\u770?}\u8196?=\u8196?(\u8197?{\i a}\u8196?\u8614?\u8196?({\i a},\u8198?{\i f}({\i a}))\u8197?)

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Using the elements from the previous exercise, we know that {\i f\u770?} is injective from {\i A} into {\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}. This property is inherited to any restriction of the codomain {\i Z}\u8196?\u8838?\u8196?{\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}, and corresponding implied restriction of the domain to {\i Y}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i f\u770?}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}({\i Z})\u8196?\u8838?\u8196?{\i A}.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Firstly, elements of \u8477? are equivalent by this map (they have the same output) if they vary by 1 from each other.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Secondly, as mentioned, we have a bijection {\i f\u771?} between \u8477?/\u8764? and {\i S}{\super 1}, the circle group of unit complex numbers, namely {\i f\u771?}\u8196?=\u8196?({\i x}\u8196?\u8614?\u8196?{\i e}{\super 2{\i \u960?}{\i i}{\i x}}, where each element {\i x} of \u8477?/\u8764? can be understood to correspond to a (class representative) value in the interval [0,\u8198?1[.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Formulate precisely what it means to say that "1{\sub {\i a}} is an identity with respect to composition" in Example 3.3, and prove this assertion.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Example 3.3 is that of a category over a set {\i S} with a (reflexive, transitive) relation \u8764?, where the objects of the category are the elements of {\i S}, and the homset between two elements {\i a} and {\i b} is the singleton ({\i a},\u8198?{\i b}) if {\i a}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}, and \u8709? otherwise. Composition \u8728? is given by transitivity of \u8764?, where ({\i b},\u8198?{\i c})\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?({\i a},\u8198?{\i b})\u8196?=\u8196?({\i a},\u8198?{\i c}). Reflexivity gives the identities ({\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i a}}\u8196?=\u8196?({\i a},\u8198?{\i a}) for any element {\i a}).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In this context, to say that "1{\sub {\i a}} is an identity with respect to composition" means that we can cancel out an element of the form ({\i a},\u8198?{\i a}) from a composition.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Formally, we have:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \u8704?{\i a},\u8198?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S},\u8198?({\i b},\u8198?{\i b})\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?({\i a},\u8198?{\i b})\u8196?=\u8196?({\i a},\u8198?{\i b})\u8196?=\u8196?({\i a},\u8198?{\i b})\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?({\i a},\u8198?{\i a})\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Can we define a category in the style of Example 3.3, using the relation < on the set \u8484? ?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 (Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Naively, saying like in example 3.3 "there is a singleton homset Hom({\i a},\u8198?{\i b}) each time we have {\i a}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i b}", we cannot define such a category, since < is not reflexive, and we would thus lack identity morphisms.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 However, in a roundabout way, we can define a category over the {\i negation} of <: "there is a singleton homset Hom({\i a},\u8198?{\i b}) each time we DO NOT have {\i a}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i b}". Namely this corresponds to the relation \u8805?, which is, itself, reflexive, transitive (and antisymmetric), and is a valid instance of the kind of category presented in example 3.3.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In fact, the pair (\u8484?,\u8198?\u8196?\u8805?\u8196?) is an instance of what is called a "totally ordered set", which is a more restrictive kind of "partially ordered set" (also called "poset" for short). Consequently, this kind of category is called a "poset category".\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Explain in what sense Example 3.4 is an instance of the categories considered in Example 3.3.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 (Description of example 3.3 in the exercise 3.3 just above.)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Example 3.4 describes a category {\i S\u770?} where the objects are the subsets of a set {\i S} (equivalently: elements of the powerset \u55349?\u56491?({\i S}) of {\i S}), and morphisms between two subsets {\i A} and {\i B} of {\i S} are singleton (or empty) homsets based on whether the inclusion is true (or false).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Inclusion of sets, \u8834?, is also an order relation, this time between the elements of a set of sets (here, \u55349?\u56491?({\i S})). This means inclusion is reflexive, transitive, and antisymmetric. This makes {\i S\u770?} a poset category, and thus another instance of example 3.3.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs24 3.6)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Define a category {\i V} by taking {\i O}{\i b}{\i j}({\i V})\u8196?=\u8196?\u8469?, and {\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub {\i V}}({\i n},\u8198?{\i m})\u8196?=\u8196?{\i M}{\i a}{\i t}{\sub \u8477?}({\i m},\u8198?{\i n}), the set of {\i m}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i n} matrices with real entries, for all {\i n},\u8198?{\i m}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8469?. (I will leave the reader the task to make sense of a matrix with 0 rows or columns.) Use product of matrices to define composition. Does this category \u8217'feel\u8217' familiar ?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The formulation of the exercise is strange. It says to use the product of matrices to define composition, and to have homsets be sets of matrices, but objects of the category are supposed to be integers. I don\u8217't know of any matrix with real entries that maps an integer to an integer in this way.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We thus infer that the meaning of the exercise can be one of two things.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Either we suppose the set of objects could rather be understood as "something isomorphic to \u8469?", ie, the collection of real vector spaces with finite bases (ie, \u8704?{\i n}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8469?,\u8198?\u8477?{\super {\i n}}). In which case, this is just the category of real vector spaces with finite basis (and linear maps as morphisms), which is a subcategory of the category real vector spaces (commonly called {\i V}{\i e}{\i c}{\i t}{\sub \u8477?}). In this context, any morphism starting from 0\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?\u8477?{\super 0}\u8196?=\u8196?\{0\} is just the injection of the origin into the codomain; and any morphism ending at 0 is the mapping of all elements to the origin.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Otherwise, we understand this as "yes, the objects of the category are integers: this means you should ignore the actual content of the matrices, and instead consider only their effect on the dimensionality of domains and codomains". In this case, this category is a complete directed graph over \u8469? where each edge corresponds to the change in dimension (from domain to codomain) caused by a given linear map.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Example 3.7 (on coslice categories) refers to example 3.5 (on slice categories). Let\u8217's go over slice categories (since example 3.5 asks the reader to "check all [their various properties]").\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs20 3.7.1) Slice categories\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Slice categories are categories made by singling out an object (say {\i A}) in some parent (larger) category (say \u55349?\u56478?), and studying all morphisms into that object. These morphisms become the objects of a new category (ie, for any {\i Z} of \u55349?\u56478?, {\i f}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}) is an object of the slice category, called \u55349?\u56478?{\sub {\i A}} in this context). In the slice category, morphisms are defined as those morphism in \u55349?\u56478? that preserve composition between 2 morphisms into {\i A}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Note that there exist pairs of morphisms {\i f}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}) and {\i f}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i Z}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}) between which there is no morphism that exists in the slice category. One such example we can make is in ({\i V}{\i e}{\i c}{\i t}{\sub \u8477?}){\sub \u8477?{\super 2}} (see notes "On the morphisms of slice and coslice categories" for more details).\par}

Also, since the only maps post-{\i f} are maps from {\i A}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}, we have {\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}} as the (post-/left-)unit for every morphism {\i f} (ie, {\i f}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i i}{\i d}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i f}.\par}

This is expressed as the following commutative diagram.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Composition of morphisms is then defined as {\i \u964?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8728?{\sub {\i A}}{\i \u963?}{\sub {\i A}} as a mapping from {\i f}{\sub 1} to {\i f}{\sub 3}, such that {\i f}{\sub 1}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i f}{\sub 3}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?({\i \u964?}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i \u963?}).

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 A subcategory \u55349?\u56478?\u8242? of a category \u55349?\u56478? consists of a collection of objects of \u55349?\u56478?, with morphisms {\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?\u8242?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i B})\u8196?\u8838?\u8196?{\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i B}) for all objects {\i A}, {\i B} in {\i O}{\i b}{\i j}(\u55349?\u56478?\u8242?), such that identities and compositions in \u55349?\u56478? make \u55349?\u56478?\u8242? into a category. A subcategory \u55349?\u56478?\u8242? is {\i full} if {\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?\u8242?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i B})\u8196?=\u8196?{\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i B}) for all {\i A}, {\i B} in {\i O}{\i b}{\i j}(\u55349?\u56478?\u8242?). Construct a category of {\i infinite sets} and explain how it may be viewed as a full subcategory of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 To put it less technically, a "subcategory" \u55349?\u56478?\u8242? is just "picking only certain items of a base category \u55349?\u56478?, and making sure that things stay closed uneder morphism composition". It is "full" if {\i all} morphisms between the objects that remain are also conserved.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We can construct a category {\b I}{\b n}{\b f}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} of infinite sets by taking all the objects {\i A} of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} such that \u8708?{\i n}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8469?,\u8198?|{\i A}|\u8196?=\u8196?{\i n}, and only homsets between these objects. This is clearly a subcategory of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, since it inherits all identity morphisms, composition works the same, and so does associativity; also, restricting the choice of homsets makes it so that the category is closed (you can\u8217't reach a finite set via a homset that went from an infinite to a finite set).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 For this category to not be full, there would need to be some homset that loses a morphism, or fully disappears, in the ordeal. However, there is no restriction as to the kind of morphism that is conserved, so any homset that is kept is identical to its original version. Finally, homsets between infinite sets are also infinite sets, so they don\u8217't disappear in this operation.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Consequently {\b I}{\b n}{\b f}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} defined as such is a full subcategory of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t}.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 An alternative to the notion of multiset introduced in \u167?2.2 is obtained by considering sets endowed with equivalence relations; equivalent elements are taken to be multiple instances of elements \u8217'of the same kind\u8217'. Define a notion of morphism between such enhanced sets, obtaining a category {\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} containing (a \u8217'copy\u8217' of) {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} as a full subcategory. (There may be more than one reasonable way to do this! This is intentionally an open-ended exercise.) Which objects in {\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} determine ordinary multisets as defined in \u167?2.2, and how? Spell out what a morphism of multisets would be from this point of view. (There are several natural notions of morphisms of multisets. Try to define morphisms in MSet so that the notion you obtain for ordinary multisets captures your intuitive understanding of these objects.) [\u167?2.2, \u167?3.2, 4.5]\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let us recall how multisets were defined in \u167?2.2. Since duplicate elements do not exist in sets, multisets were instead defined as functions from a set {\i S} to \u8469?*, the set of (nonzero) positive integers. This allows each element in {\i S} to have a "count", thereby encoding the intuitive notion of multiset. A similar, and equivalent (isomorphic), way of defining it is {\i via} pairs ({\i s},\u8198?{\i n})\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i S}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?*, which is simpler to think about. We\u8217'll call this category {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, for "count multiset" (TODO: probably has a conventional and better name, but I don\u8217't know it). As for morphisms in {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, we can consider that for any multisets {\i A}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?* and {\i B}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i S}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?*, the homset from {\i A} to {\i B} is simply the set functions from {\i S}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?* to {\i S}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?\u8469?* as usual.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We first notice that if we restrict {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} to only the objects for which all elements have a count of 1, and where morphisms only ever output to \{1\} in the second coordinate (a subcategory we can call {\b C}{\b 1}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, for example), we get a "copy" of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t}: {\b C}{\b 1}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} and {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} are isomorphic in {\b C}{\b a}{\b t}. This is a full subcategory because there are no morphisms that map counts to anything else than \{1\} if we restrict our objects to this form; so all morphisms between the kept objects are also kept.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Now let us do a similar construction, but based on equivalence classes instead. We know that each equivalence class over a set corresponds uniquely to a partition of that set. By considering only these partitions (these "sets of sets") as objects, we can build a category {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} (for "equivalence multiset"). The "count" corresponds simply to the cardinal of a top-level element in the partition. For example, the top-level elements of {\i M}\u8196?=\u8196?\{{\i S}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i S}{\sub 3}\}\u8196?=\u8196?\{\{{\i a}\},\u8198?\{{\i b},\u8198?{\i c}\},\u8198?\{{\i d},\u8198?{\i e},\u8198?{\i f}\}\} would be understood to have counts |{\i S}{\sub 1}|\u8196?=\u8196?1, |{\i S}{\sub 2}|\u8196?=\u8196?2 and |{\i S}{\sub 3}|\u8196?=\u8196?3 respectively.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 As for morphisms in {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}, they simply map each top-level element of the domain multiset (a distinct subset of the original set) to some other top-level elements in the codomain multiset. This has precisely the same effect as mapping pairs of "value and count" as seen in the previous {\b C}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} construction.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In this example, any set itself, when "injected" (by a functor) into {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} would just nest all of its elements into singletons. I.e., {\i S}\u8196?=\u8196?\{{\i a},\u8198?{\i b},\u8198?{\i c}\} in {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} would become {\i S}\u8196?=\u8196?\{\{{\i a}\},\u8198?\{{\i b}\},\u8198?\{{\i c}\}\} in {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t}. This also shows how restricting {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} to "only objects that are a set of (toplevel) singletons" makes {\b E}{\b M}{\b S}{\b e}{\b t} have a "copy" of {\b S}{\b e}{\b t} as a full subcategory (for similar arguments as above).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Yet another example could be something akin to polynomials with integer coefficients on freeform indeterminates of degree 1 (which would be our set elements); raising the operators one rank, a product of freeform variables with integer powers (multiplicities), etc.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since the objects of a category \u55349?\u56478? are not (necessarily) sets, it is not clear how to make sense of a notion of \u8217'subobject\u8217' in general. In some situations it does make sense to talk about subobjects, and the subobjects of any given object {\i A} in \u55349?\u56478? are in one-to-one correspondence with the morphisms {\i A}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i \u937?} for a fixed, special object {\i \u937?} of \u55349?\u56478?, called a subobject classifier.

For any subset {\i A} of {\i B}, there is a unique map {\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i B}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?\u55349?\u56633?, such that \u8704?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i B},\u8198?{\i f}({\i b})\u8196?=\u8196?1\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?{\i b}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i A} (otherwise {\i f}({\i b})\u8196?=\u8196?0, of course, as the equivalence and lack of alternatives to 0 as an output imply).

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Composition is defined for {\i two} morphisms. If more than 2 morphisms are given, one may compose them in several ways, so that every step only consists in composing 2 morphisms. Prove that for any such valid sequence of morphisms, the order of parentheses doesn\u8217't matter.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This boils down to showing that associativity is a global property, that doesn\u8217't just make parentheses meaningless when there are 3 elements and 2 operators between them, but in general {\i n} elements with ({\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1) operators between them.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Note: A useful way of visualizing this is representing the order of operations as a binary tree, and noticing that applying associativity (forwards or backwards) is just a tree rotation (resp. right or left) at a given node. Then it is easy to show that one can always obtain a "left comb binary tree". Since every choice of parentheses is equal to this left comb choice, and equality is transitive, every choice of parentheses is equal to every other choice.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 To be more rigorous, we will proceed by induction.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Hypothesis: {\i P}({\i n}) = "for a given {\i n}, for {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1} any valid, composable, ordered sequence of morphisms in our base category \u55349?\u56478?, any choice {\i H} of parentheses to compose elements of this sequence 2-by-2, giving a formula {\i s}{\sub {\i H}}, will lead to the same result, which can be seen by always having {\i s}{\sub {\i H}}\u8196?=\u8196?(\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?({\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1})\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?){\i f}{\sub 1}".\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Initialization: We initialize at {\i n}\u8196?=\u8196?3; the validity is immediate as it is precisely the definition of associativity.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Heredity: We suppose the hypothesis {\i P}({\i n}) true for a given {\i n}\u8196?\u8805?\u8196?3; let us show that this implies that the hypothesis is true for {\i P}({\i n}\u8197?+\u8197?1).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 What this means is that, no matter the composable ordered sequence {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1} of {\i n} functions, for a fixed {\i n}, the order of parentheses does not matter. Note that though {\i n} is chosen and fixed; the statement is true for EVERY (ordered, composable) sequence of functions. We add a new function {\i g} to this sequence. By a simple renaming of the functions, we deduce that it doesn\u8217't matter where we insert {\i g}, so we\u8217'll insert it at the very right to simplify our argument, giving us the sequence {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1}{\i g}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Here, there are 3 cases. Either:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i g} is part of the last composition (i.e., it\u8217's not in a semantically necessary parenthethical grouping; it can be made external to all parentheses),\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i g} is part of the first composition (i.e., the first operation is ({\i f}{\sub 1}{\i g}))\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab it isn\u8217't either (it\u8217's inside some non-removable parentheses, and needs to be composed earlier on, but not as the first operation).\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If {\i g} is part of the last composition, then by applying the hypothesis {\i P}({\i n}) to the terms {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1}, we immediately find that our new sequence can be made equal to ((\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?({\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1})\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?){\i f}{\sub 1}){\i g}, which is precisely what we wanted for {\i P}({\i n}\u8197?+\u8197?1).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If {\i g} is part of the first composition, we isolate it so that it isn\u8217't anymore. To do so, we apply "backwards" associativity on the grouping of terms {\i F}{\sub {\i k}}({\i f}{\sub 1}{\i g}) in order to obtain ({\i F}{\sub {\i k}}{\i f}{\sub 1}){\i g}, where {\i F}{\sub {\i k}} is the appropriate choice of ({\i f}{\sub {\i k}}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 2}) such that associativity can be applied (with 2\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i k}\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i n}). This makes it so that our problem is identical to our final case, solved just below.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 If {\i g} is part of neither the first nor last composition, then we consider the innermost composition ({\i f}{\sub {\i k}}{\i f}{\sub {\i k}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}) to be a single element {\i h}. We now have a sequence of only {\i n} terms. We apply our hypothesis {\i P}({\i n}). This makes {\i g} the outermost right term, part of the last composition. Unravelling {\i h} back into two members, we see that we are back at our initial case, with an arbitrary order of parentheses for the {\i f}{\sub {\i n}}{\i f}{\sub {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i f}{\sub 1} terms, and {\i g} outermost. We already saw that this implied {\i P}({\i n}\u8197?+\u8197?1).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Conclusion: since we have initialization and heredity of our hypothesis in all cases, we can conclude by induction that it is true for all {\i n}\u8196?\u8805?\u8196?3.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We remind example 4.6 : a groupoid is a category in which every morphism is an isomorphism. This means that every morphism needs to be 2-way invertible.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 In this context, this means that for every morphism {\i a}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i b}, there should be a corresponding inverse morphism {\i b}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a}. This property is precisely the symmetry of a relation.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We recall that in the way we formulated this, morphisms were just simple set functions on "(element, count)" pairs (i.e., returning any other "(element, count)" pair of the codomain).

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 First we will prove that it is initial, then that it is unique.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Initiality: we take an arbitrary set {\i Z} in {\b Set}. We wish to study $Hom_\{\\text\{\\textbf\{Set\}\}\}(\\emptyset, Z) = Z^\\emptyset$. We recall that functions (in category theory) are defined as "applications" / "mappings" are in traditional set theory (i.e., as a relation between sets where every antecedent in the domain has a singleton image in the codomain; the key point being that "no input has no result when passed through the function"). Let {\i I} be an initial element in {\b Set}. We write |{\i I}|\u8196?=\u8196?{\i n} and |{\i Z}|\u8196?=\u8196?{\i m}. We know that |{\i Z}{\super {\i I}}|\u8196?=\u8196?|{\i Z}|{\super |{\i I}|}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i m}{\super {\i n}}. For {\i I} to be initial, this is true if and only if {\i m}{\super {\i n}}\u8196?=\u8196?1 for all {\i m}, and so if and only if {\i n}\u8196?=\u8196?0. We recall that the empty set is the only set with |\u8709?|\u8196?=\u8196?0, therefore {\i I}\u8196?=\u8196?\u8709?.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Now this is already enough to prove unicity, but let us spell it out for pedagogy\u8217's sake.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Unicity: We recall that two objects of {\b Set} are isomorphic if, and only if, there exists a bijection between them. This is equivalent to saying that two sets have the same cardinal. We once again recall that the empty set is the only set with |\u8709?|\u8196?=\u8196?0; there are no bijections relating to the empty set, other than its identity, the unique morphism in $Hom_\{\\text\{\\textbf\{Set\}\}\}(\\emptyset, \\emptyset)$ . Using proposition 5.4 (that terminal objects are unique up-to-isomorphism), we finally deduce that \u8709? is the unique initial object in {\b Set}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 NB: the unique function in {\i Z}{\super \u8709?} is always the empty function.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Prove that final objects are unique up to isomorphism.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let us suppose we have a category \u55349?\u56478? with two final objects, {\i F}{\sub 1} and {\i F}{\sub 2}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 For every object {\i A} of \u55349?\u56478? there is at least one element in {\i H}{\i o}{\i m}{\sub \u55349?\u56478?}({\i A},\u8198?{\i A}), namely the identity 1{\sub {\i A}}. If {\i F} is final, then there is a unique morphism {\i F}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}, which therefore must be the identity 1{\sub {\i F}}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We assumed that {\i F}{\sub 1} and {\i F}{\sub 2} are both final in \u55349?\u56478?. Since {\i F}{\sub 1} is final, there is a unique morphism {\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 2}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1} in \u55349?\u56478?. Since {\i F}{\sub 2} is final, there is a unique morphism {\i g}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 2} in \u55349?\u56478?. Consider {\i f}{\i g}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 1} ; as observed, necessarily the composite {\i f}{\i g}\u8196?=\u8196?1{\sub {\i F}{\sub 1}} since {\i F}{\sub 1} is final. By the same token {\i g}{\i f}\u8196?=\u8196?1{\sub {\i F}{\sub 2}}. Thus {\i f} and {\i g} are inverses of each other, proving {\i f} is an isomorphism. Since there exists an isomorphism between {\i F}{\sub 1} and {\i F}{\sub 2}, {\i F}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8771?\u8196?{\i F}{\sub 2}.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 What are initial and final objects in the category of "pointed sets" (Example 3.8)? Are they unique?\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We recall that a pointed set is just a regular set with a special, identified point, and that the category of pointed sets {\b Set*} is built upon the same objects as {\b Set}, but where each object {\i A} in {\b Set} is multiplied into |{\i A}| copies of itself in {\b Set*} (one for each choice of special point; this implies that the empty set is not a part of {\b Set*}, since it has no point). Morphisms in {\b Set*} are set functions, but with the restriction of mapping the special point in the domain to the special point in the codomain.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Given this information, we will prove that the initial and final objects in {\b Set*} are the singleton sets.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let ({\i O},\u8198?{\i o}) be a singleton set in {\b Set*}. Let {\i o} be the single element of {\i O}; it is necessarily also the special point, as there is no other choice. For any codomain ({\i Z},\u8198?{\i z}{\sub 0}) in {\b Set*}, the condition that "special points map to special points" restricts our choice of function to the unique function ({\i o},\u8198?{\i z}{\sub 0}), thus, {\i O} is initial. If {\i O} had more than one element, there would exist some {\i Z} (non-singletons) for which the other element would allow another degree of freedom (and thus {\i O} would not be initial).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Similarly, now studying {\i Z} as a domain and {\i O} as a codomain, we see that that only function from {\i Z} to {\i O} is (like in {\b Set}) the function which maps everything (including {\i Z}\u8217's special point) to {\i o}. Thus, {\i O} is final. If {\i O} had more than one element, there would similarly be many choices for any {\i Z} of cardinal \u8196?\u8805?\u8196?2, so long as the special point maps to the special point.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Every singleton pointed set is both initial and final in {\b Set*} and is thus a zero object. These are also the only such pointed sets.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 First, we remind the universal property for quotients. Given an equivalence relation \u8764? over a set {\i A}, there is a single map {\i \u960?}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i A}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}/\u8764? such that, for any map {\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i A}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i Z} verifying {\i f}({\i a}{\sub 1})\u8196?=\u8196?{\i f}({\i a}{\sub 2}) whenever {\i a}{\sub 1}\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?{\i a}{\sub 2} (i.e., the morphism {\i f} is "well-defined" for the equivalence relation \u8764?), there exists a unique map $\\overline\{f\} : A/\\sim \\to Z$ such that $f = \\overline\{f\} \\circ \\pi$. This is summarized in the following commutative diagram:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We now apply the universal property of products to obtain the following commutative diagram:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We then consider a well-defined map {\i f}\u8196?:\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i Z} (i.e., {\i f}({\i a}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 1})\u8196?=\u8196?{\i f}({\i a}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 2}) whenever ({\i a}{\sub 1},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 1})\u8196?\u8764?\u8196?({\i a}{\sub 2},\u8198?{\i b}{\sub 2})). We apply the universal property of quotients to the relation \u8764? defined over {\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}. We define the map {\i \u960?}\u8196?:\u8196?{\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})/\u8764? as {\i \u960?}({\i a},\u8198?{\i b})\u8196?=\u8196?[({\i a},\u8198?{\i b})]{\sub \u8764?}. We define the map $\\overline\{f\} : (A \\times B)/\\sim \\; \\to \\; Z$ as $\\overline\{f\}([(a,b)]_\\sim) = f(a,b)$. We remind that such an {\i f} is unique, and that $\\overline\{f\} \\circ \\pi = f$.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We do a similar construction for {\i A}/\u8764?{\sub {\i A}} with {\i f}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i B}/\u8764?{\sub {\i B}} with {\i f}{\sub {\i B}}. We can do so since these maps are also well-defined. Indeed, we have:\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The combination of all previous steps gives us the following commutative diagram.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Let us recap a little what\u8217's in diagram a little, to show that it is a justified construction:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B} is a product, and so we may obtain {\i p}{\sub {\i A}}, {\i p}{\sub {\i B}}, {\i f}{\sub {\i A}}, and {\i f}{\sub {\i B}};\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i f} is well-defined for the equivalence relation \u8764?, and so we may obtain $\\overline\{f\}$ and {\i \u960?};\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i f}{\sub {\i A}} is well-defined for the equivalence relation \u8764?{\sub {\i A}}, and so we may obtain $\\overline\{f_A\}$ and {\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}};\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li360 \fi-360 \bullet \tx360\tab {\i f}{\sub {\i B}} is well-defined for the equivalence relation \u8764?{\sub {\i B}}, and so we may obtain $\\overline\{f_B\}$ and {\i \u960?}{\sub {\i B}};\sa180\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Therefore, we have the maps {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i p}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i A}/\u8764?{\sub {\i A}} and {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i B}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i p}{\sub {\i B}}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})\u8196?\u8594?\u8196?{\i B}/\u8764?{\sub {\i B}}. {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i B}} are well-defined because they are compositions of well-defined maps. For {\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i \u960?}{\sub {\i B}}, we know that the projector and unique function part (of the universal property of quotients) are necessarily well-defined, otherwise they wouldn\u8217't compose to a well-defined map. As for {\i p}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i p}{\sub {\i B}}, they are well-defined because they are projections, and projections are always well-defined.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i \u928?}{\sub {\i B}} are well-defined, we can "quotient through" (i.e., use the universal property of quotient for) ({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})/\u8764?.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This gives us the following commutative diagram (compatible with the one above, but it\u8217's too messy to represent both at the same time):\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 These are precisely our functions $\\overline\{\\Pi_A\} \\in (A \\times B)/\\sim \\; \\to \\; A/\\sim_A$ and $\\overline\{\\Pi_B\} \\in (A \\times B)/\\sim \\; \\to \\; B/\\sim_B$, and they are unique, as per the universal property of quotients.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 \b \fs20 5.11.b)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 What we wish to prove now is that ({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})/\u8764? is the product of {\i A}/\u8764?{\sub {\i A}} and {\i B}/\u8764?{\sub {\i B}}. Said otherwise, we wish to show that, for all {\i Z}, {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} in the appropriate configuration, the following diagram commutes:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Using the fact that ({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B}) is already a product, and studying maps {\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i h}{\sub {\i B}} from {\i Z} into {\i A} and {\i B} respectively, we can make the following commutative diagram:\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The internal parts of the diagram (except {\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i h}{\sub {\i B}} which are arbitrary, all other arrows are unique morphisms) force {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} to commute with the rest of the diagram: any pairs of maps {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} that make the diagram commute must necessarily be constrained by the existing morphisms (as the composition of unique morphisms). Any choice of maps {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} must respect {\i g}{\sub {\i A}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i A}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}{\sub {\i B}}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?{\i h}{\sub {\i B}}, for corresponding arbitrary (but inferred) {\i h}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i h}{\sub {\i B}}; said otherwise, maps {\i g}{\sub {\i A}} and {\i g}{\sub {\i B}} in this configuration can only exist if they make the diagram commute. Therefore, we have shown that ({\i A}\u8197?\u215?\u8197?{\i B})/\u8764? satisfies the universal property of the product of {\i A}/\u8764?{\sub {\i A}} and {\i B}/\u8764?{\sub {\i B}}, and we have ({\i g}{\sub {\i A}},\u8198?{\i g}{\sub {\i B}})\u8196?=\u8196?{\i \u960?}\u8197?\u8728?\u8197?({\i h}{\sub {\i A}},\u8198?{\i h}{\sub {\i B}}) (though it\u8217's not shown on the above diagram, in order to improve legibility).\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We know that elements that verify a common universal property are terminal objects (of the same kind) in some comma category.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The \u8217'multiplication table\u8217' of a group is an array compiling the results of all multiplications {\i g}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i h} (with the value on each row being the left operand, and the value on each column being the right operand; of course the table depends on the order in which the elements are listed in the top row and leftmost column). Prove that every row and every column of the multiplication table of a group contains all elements of the group exactly once (like Sudoku diagrams!).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Another way to phrase this question is "prove that every element of the group can be reached in a single operation from any other (on the left, or on the right, both work)". Written in function notation, this means:\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 For every element {\i a}, we can reach the identity with {\i a}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1} (on either side). Every element {\i b} can then be reached from the identity by multiplying it (on either side). We just have to pick the same side both times to find either {\i g}{\sub {\i r}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i b}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i a}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1} and {\i g}{\sub {\i c}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i a}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i b}. Since the group is closed under "multiplication", both these elements are guaranteed to exist.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 This implies that every row and every column of the multiplication table of a group contains all elements of the group exactly once, since any element can be reached in a single multiplication (i.e., there as many possible inputs (1 sided operand) as possible outputs (i.e., applying an operand is an injection) and all outputs are reached (it\u8217's also a surjection)). This also implies that the multiplication table is a "Latin square", which is a square array of |{\i G}| symbols, each occurring exactly once in each row and exactly once in each column.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 The second possibility where one element other than the identity is its own inverse, and the other two are mutual inverses. This gives you a group that is isomorphic to (\u8484?{\sub 4},\u8198?\u8197?+\u8197?) (a four-hour clock with addition, where 1 and \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1 are mutual inverses, and 0 and 2 are their own inverse). Note that the permutations of the elements of the group give the same table, so there is only one table for this group up to reordering.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since the identity and respective inverses commute, all that\u8217's left is to check the commutativity of the self-inverse element {\i a} with both of the mutual-inverses elements {\i b} and {\i c}. In this case, it is because there is "only one option left" in the Latin square that we get commutativity: e.g., {\i a}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i b} cannot equal {\i e} since they are not inverses, cannot equal {\i a} since {\i b}\u8196?\u8800?\u8196?{\i e}, cannot equal {\i b} since {\i a}\u8196?\u8800?\u8196?{\i e}, so we must have {\i a}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i b}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i c}. The same reasoning can be applied to {\i b}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i a} to get {\i c} (hence {\i a}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i b}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i b}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i a}). With a relabelling, we apply this reasoning to {\i a}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i c} to get {\i b} and to {\i c}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i a} to get {\i b} (hence {\i a}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i c}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i c}\u8197?\u8901?\u8197?{\i a}). With this, we have proven commutativity.\par}

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Prove Corollary 1.11: Let {\i g} be an element of finite order, and let {\i n}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484?. Then {\i g}{\super {\i n}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i e}\u8196?\u8660?\u8196?\u8707?{\i k}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484?,\u8198?{\i n}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i k}|{\i g}| ({\i n} is a multiple of |{\i g}|).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 By Lemma 1.10, if {\i g}{\super {\i n}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i e}, then |{\i g}| divides {\i n}. Therefore, \u8707?{\i k}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?\u8484?,\u8198?{\i n}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i k}|{\i g}|.\par}

Also, the order of operation is not given: this gives us a hint that the property ({\i \u928?}{\sub {\i g}\u8196?\u8712?\u8196?{\i G}}\u8197?{\i g}){\super 2}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i e} does not rely on the order of operations.)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Since {\i f} is the only element which is a self-inverse of order 2, {\i e} is the only self-inverse of order 1, we have that for all other elements a {\i g} in {\i G}, {\i g} is not its own inverse. This means that the product of all elements of {\i G} is a product of pairs of inverses, which cancel out to the identity (given commutativity), except for the self-inverse {\i f} which remains.

{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Describe generators and relations for all dihedral groups {\i D}{\sub 2{\i n}}. (Hint: let {\i x} be the reflection about a line through the center of a regular {\i n}-gon and a vertex, and let {\i y} be counterclockwise rotation by 2{\i \u960?}/{\i n}. The group {\i D}{\sub 2{\i n}} will be generated by {\i x} and {\i y}, subject to three relations. To see that these relations really determine {\i D}{\sub 2{\i n}}, use them to show that any product {\i x}{\super {\i i}{\sub 1}}{\i y}{\super {\i i}{\sub 2}}{\i x}{\super {\i i}{\sub 3}}{\i y}{\super {\i i}{\sub 4}}\u8230? equals {\i x}{\super {\i i}}{\i y}{\super {\i j}} for some {\i i}, {\i j} with 0\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i i}\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?1, 0\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i j}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i n}.)\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 Two of the relations are very easy to see: {\i x}{\super 2}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i e} (for any axial symmetry flip {\i x}) and {\i y}{\super {\i n}}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i e} (for any {\i n}-rotation {\i y}). Another hint (given at the bottom of page 52, as done on an imaginary pentagon) tells us to study {\i y}{\i x}{\i y}{\i x} (hinting that it is equal to {\i e}).\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We first note that {\i x}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i x} since any axial symmetry is an involution. Geometrically speaking, we can see that the operation {\i x}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}{\i y}{\i x} is a rotation by 2{\i \u960?}/{\i n} in the opposite direction to {\i y}. We can thus write {\i x}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}{\i y}{\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i y}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}, and thus {\i y}{\i x}{\i y}{\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i e}. This is our 3rd relation, which we can also rewrite as {\i y}{\i x}\u8196?=\u8196?\u8196?=\u8196?{\i x}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}{\i y}{\super \u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}\u8196?=\u8196?{\i x}{\i y}{\super {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1}.\par}
{\pard \ql \f0 \sa180 \li0 \fi0 We can now write any element of {\i D}{\sub 2{\i n}} as {\i x}{\super {\i i}}{\i y}{\super {\i j}} for 0\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i i}\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?1, 0\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i j}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i n}. Any power of {\i x} reduces to {\i e} (if the exponent is even) or {\i x} (if the exponent is odd), any power {\i k} of {\i y} reduces to {\i y}{\super [{\i k}]{\sub {\i n}}}, and any {\i y}{\i x} term sandwiched between an {\i x} and a {\i y} terms can be changed to {\i x}{\i y}{\super {\i n}\u8197?\u8722?\u8197?1} in order to reduce with the {\i x} (or {\i e}) on the left, and the {\i y}{\super [{\i k}]{\sub {\i n}}} on the right. Through this algorithm, we can always get an element of the form {\i x}{\super {\i i}}{\i y}{\super {\i j}} for 0\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i i}\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?1, 0\u8196?\u8804?\u8196?{\i j}\u8196?<\u8196?{\i n}.\par}
